It is a permanent companion, and quite strong, but if it dies, the ring breaks. It takes a full round action to dismiss the snake, and the player must be adjacent to the serpent at this time.

These mystical stone's distort the holder's voice into in incomprehensible gibberish to all listeners. The only way to make sense of it is to hold another stone of this set./Arrow of Traveling - the arrow's head is a small piece of quartz. When fired from a bow, the arrow activates.
