These mystical stone's distort the holder's voice into in incomprehensible gibberish to all listeners.

If they sing a song related to what they are doing (both in character and OOC), they get a bonus to it at the discretion of the DM. For example, if the Ranger sings \"Shot to the heart or And you're to blame or You gave love or A bad name,\" I would rule that he gets an auto-crit if he hits.

When wearing them, one can feel an energy around their hands, as though there was something just out of reach. If one grasps, the feel of solid, polished wood stimulates the tips of your fingers. A strong grip, a taut string; a bow. Pulling the bow string back, you can almost feel an arrow coalesce in your fingers. It's aim will be true. Upon release of the arrow, the radius bone of the user's straight arm shatters, and a long thin shard fires through their arm, splitting through their wrist and knuckles toward the target with deadly force, causing a great deal of (nonlethal) pain to the user./44Arrow of  transfer - When something is hit with this arrow, archer and target swap places./44 Claws of the phoenix - Aspergillum with a large phoenix imprinted on the back.

This bolt, because it has no safe surfaces to handle it from, must be treated as if it were poisoned - there is a 5% chance the user slashes themselves with the bolt. As Fafhrd loads the bolt into his crossbow, he casts Heat Metal on it - and the razored fletching means that when it strikes a target, it cannot be removed without a DC 15 Heal check. An enemy who takes damage from the Heat Metal spell must make a Will save to avoid panicking and flailing madly at the bolt - if their hands are unprotected they take 1d6 slashing damage and temporarily lose half that damage in Dexterity./Stargazer's Potion/This potion was originally used by astrologers in my campaign, but it quickly found favor among night watchmen for obvious reasons.

The Toxin of Intense Thirst can dehydrate the body so quickly the person dies of thirst within a few hours. Many times, autopsies cannot distinguish blindly whether a person has died from this poison or from weeks spent in a desert. What makes the poison particularly deadly is that it has no taste. It can be used to salt foods just as normal salt would be and is perfectly odorless. This poison is incredibly expensive because of the difficulty of obtaining the Nerium oleander plant due to its toxicity. It is valued at over 500,000 gold pieces. /Draught of Wishful Thinking – (Uncommon, Potion). This draught was created in Estafer, a small town near the southern coast of Venisia during the Bloodscrall. Originally, the draught was created as a potion believed to allow for future sight.

Its effect became quickly addictive and many people quit working just to enjoy the effects. The trade of it sped up immensely as people realized the effects that it provided. Unfortunately, many people began using the drug and because they used it to a point that they were constantly high rather than eating or drinking, they quickly began dying.
