It's reckon'd ta be the towns founder. Weird how it always looks like its facing you innit! The tricks carvers can pull with perspective these days..."/Wherever the party goes, one of their number keeps seeing the same black cat. It's impossible it can be a coincidence, for the cat they keep seeing has a distinct crescent of white fur on its forehead. No matter how hard they look, they never spot it following them from place to place, and if they search they never find it hiding amidst the wagons of any caravan they might join. But no matter where they travel (even on other planes), no matter how quickly they manage to get there (even by teleportation), it is always there first. Every time it appears, the situation is such that the only person who has line of sight to the cat is the one character who always sees it. To the other characters the cat is a mere figment, and a cause for worry about the mental health of their friend./The city of Skarsdale is cursed; the symbol of the Evil Eye keeps appearing around the city. Burned into a wooden windowsill. As frost on a window in winter. Baked into bread. Items knocked over fall into the shape of it. It's never done deliberately (who would do that?) and it's appearances are seemingly random, all except one. Every morning, without exception, the eye is daubed in blood on the city-facing wall of Skarsdale Castle, above the drawbridge. Even when watched all night, the mark appears as if by magic - but no magic is detected./A song can be heard drifting across the city at night, but only by a handful of people. Without fail, those people abandon their lives the very next morning to go off and realise their unfulfilled dreams./On the third day of the third week of each month, spellcasters throughout the kingdom mysteriously misremember all their lore, spells, and rituals. Any attempt to use magic on this day results in mayhem, and may possibly be dangerous (treat as wild magic surge)./The people of Hollowbrook have a problem - they are running out of clothes. As of a week ago, any clothes left unworn (for instance, when hanging to dry after being washed) rise up into the air, pulling and allowing themselves to be ripped if need be to escape. They gather together as raggamoffyns (constructs composed of scraps of cloth - see The 3rd edition Monster Manual II or google for more info)./The little mountain town of Urmster is a happy one. Everyone is friendly, and treats each other like family. It seems idyllic, and a visitor has a perfectly wonderful time there, enjoying the ambience, the hot springs, and the many beautiful local walks. Yet a perceptive visitor may notice,ever so occasionally, the glimpse of something strange in the pupils of the townsfolk. Here one minute, gone the next, it's easy to think you imagined it: the very image of the townsperson, reflected in their own eye./While passing through town one day, the party see a queue of people backed up from a door in the wall. There is no signage to suggest what might be beyond the door. Hundreds of people are waiting to get in, and the queue goes right round the corner of the street. When they return this way they see the queue looking just as long. Close observation shows that every time someone goes through the door, which happens every two minutes and thirty seven seconds another person joins the back of the queue. Furthermore, they are the same people, on a repeating cycle. Yet no one comes out of the door and there is no rear entrance. If they try to get closer to the door to see what's inside, the people in the queue accuse them of queue-jumping and get belligerent, forming up as a mob to prevent the PCs skipping the line. If the party back up, they return exactly to their correct places in the queue./The Queen is getting married! The only thing is, no one seems to know where her mysterious suitor Lord Abgarde came from, and no one even seems curious.

When she returned to the castle, she found it was as though Lord Abgarde had always been there and everyone thought his engagement to the The Queen had lasted an entire year. Only she could see things as they truly were. The party, like everyone else in the city, have false memories regarding the bethrothal (ideally set this up so that the players themselves have no reason to believe her. Do this WAY in advance by feeding them news from the castle, or if they visit, letting them see Lord Abgarde. They should really question whether or not these memories are false)./The people of Greenvale woke morning to find their sheep grazing contentedly around the hull of a sailing vessel with the flag of the East Island Raiders, mysterious transported onto the chalk downs. The pirate crew were all dead, their bodies each laid out on the grass nearby, one hand outstretched Eastward - perhaps toward the ocean, fully five hundred miles away. The Raiders spoils was left untouched in the cargo hold, and a scrawled note pinned to one of the chests by dagger: Though these men will wrong you yet You must see and not forget Their captain will be your own get Heed this lesson or your fates are set./After tasting the meatballs at a particular roadside inn, Ikea's Table (named after the fabled table of the goddess of home and hearth, Ikea) the party feel compelled to return there as regularly as possible for more of the dish.

No pattern has yet been found in these attacks./A village has been blessed for many years with unusually bountiful harvests, even while other farmland nearby has been struck with famine.

However, upon closer inspection, the inside is dark and the house is empty./Legend says that when the Twin Crystals are combined that a portal to "paradise" will be opened. No one has ever seen the crystals, and no one knows where they are./Many speculate the existence of a coal dragon. In the town of Xelspear, black acid seems to plague the farms, and cattle goes missing. Reports of a large shadow gliding through the air does not go unnoticed, nor does the fact that the black acid hardens into coal./A simple silver band with a black opal setting in the center. When put on, the ring sheds an unnatural warmth. The stone spins, revealing an eye that stares at the wearer./The inscriptions on the tombstones in the large cemetery outside of town are always changing. Even the stones of the freshly buried. No one has ever witnessed the change./Everyone in town you encounter is humming or whistling the same eerie tune. Eventually you find yourself humming it too.../Every week, food appears in the city. This has been going on many years and the city thrives (read: no food making ability) because of it. However, this week the food is causing unknown side effects. People that eat it shrink to the size of 1 or 6th their original height./A village has suddenly started having bad dreams. They all seem to be able to remember clips from their dream and it all has the same theme. Soon the dreams are exactly the same. Soon after that, the images are seen out of the corner of people's eyes, but disappear when looked at directly. Soon after that, the monsters are shadows, but can be looked at directly, then they start killing./All the rats in the city have mysteriously vanished. This seemed a good thing, until piles of dead rat-bitten cats were found last month, and the cities food stores have begun depleting at an unexplainable rate. Last week all the former rat-killers vanished from their beds. And now, every night at the stroke of midnight, an eery otherworldly bell can be heard tolling from somewhere deep under the city./Every time anyone within 10 miles of the mysterious tower falls asleep, they dream they are being hunted by the embodiment of their worst nightmares. If they die in their dream they die in real life. The effects are slowly expanding outward from the tower, threatening a nearby settlement./Once every week, a kindly old man living on the outskirts of town sets up a small market stall where he sells beautifully hand-crafted puppets. All who browse his collection long enough will find one puppet that looks exactly like them./There are no rat-holes in plain sight anywhere to be found in town, no horrible stench or diseases run rampant and food will never go missing when left unattended. But whenever an old floorboard is replaced, a patch of dirt is disturbed or a particularly old piece of furniture needs to be moved, at least one rat always seems to be hiding just there and they always seem to get away through some small crack or hole somewhere./There's a small hut on a hill besides the road, far away from any town or city. When travellers pass by they will always see a warm, orange light coming through a window and smell a mouthwatering smell of freshly cooked supper wafting towards them. The lady of the house, whose husband will likely be home late today, will always welcome weary travellers, offering them a place by the hearth, a wonderful meal and a soft bed for the night. All who go to sleep in the hut will wake up the next morning in rotten, lice-infested sheets in the wooden ruins of something that must have been a home many, many years ago, the decaying and brittle skeleton of whoever once lived here still lying on the muddy floor by the hearth./This tiny village is contained within wooden palisade walls, ending at two usually open gates at the front and back. No sound can be heard from the village, and once you pass through its gates, no sound can be heard at all. A pan banging next to your ear is as silent as anything could ever be. This effect exists only within these wooden walls, and none of the townsfolk seem to notice./This empty town is devoid of life, but all its buildings and items remain intact. By day, it's a spot where a traveler can rest his weary head in a featherbed once belonging to some noble, or find a treasure of some kind that a blacksmith had tucked away. By night, the ground changes. Living things that touch the ground fall into it like a stone into water, and no amount of swimming can save them; they are pulled down into the unknown. The buildings are away from one another, making it hard to get from place to place. The town will not let you leave without a fight./There are no adults in this village. The kids rule in their place, and though they do not do the things that adults would do, they seem to be surviving fine. Nearby towns have not reported any of their adults coming to them, nor has anyone seen a sign from them. The only clue you have to go on is the ferocity by which the children protect the town hall's basement.../In the woods there sits a black stone, dark as night, and large as ten men on each other's shoulders. On the plateau of this rock stands ten people in a circle, old and young, men and women, and of different races. They do not acknowledge the presence of any who disturb them, and cannot be moved from the spot they stand in. In the center of their circle sits a second black stone in the shape of an egg. As day night falls and day breaks, they are unchanged. Now, though, there are only nine./At a local haberdashery, a hatter creates works that astonish and amaze even the most sophisticated of hat enthusiasts. No matter what price he sells them for, people fight to be the one to buy them. What seems odd, though, is the faint magical aura on each hat that nobody else seems to see. What caught your attention was that the aura felt a lot like an undead.../In the middle of this field sits a monk, whose strong powers can be felt a mile away. There is nothing but grass around him on all sides but one; in front of him sits a forest. This monk is engaged in heavy prayer, a ritual perhaps, and cannot move or speak. From his tattered cloths and the growth around him it appears he's been at this for a very long time, years maybe, sustained by some otherworldly force. All you know is, the more you look at the forest, the heavier you feel, and the more inclined you feel to stopping this man's prayers./A little box on the corner of a street in a small, otherwise unremarkable fishing town. Nothing special per se, where it not that objects inside always find their original owner, and have included everything from solitary socks to priceless artifacts and even the kings wedding ring./a simple beggar known as richie. People who come in contact often lose things, you could toss him a coin and find your earrings gone. Often accused, he's been frisked more than you could count, but never have any of the objects been found. He still sits on the same corner every day, not a coin to his name, watched closely, called a beggar and a thief daily./A small shack in a region tormented by the elements. 3 floods, a forest fire, 4 tornadoes and an earthquake later, nothing of the surroundings looks the same, yet the small shack still stands, untouched by nature./A non-magical rock, often used by travellers as a waypoint due to it's recognisable shape. Although you're pretty sure it was standing in the woods last time you saw it, not in the middle of a corn field../There are lots of tales of people dying peacefully in their sleep, with eyewitnesses saying the night before, the deceased got up and opened the door, reacting to a knock only they could hear./Every inn or tavern in every town, village, or city the adventurers go to has a bartender that looks and sounds exactly alike. He always goes by a different name, but everyone in the party recognizes him from each of the other places. No matter how hard he is questioned or interrogated, he has no idea what the adventurers are talking about if they confront him with it./The girl was tending the bees near their cottage at the edge of the forest; whatever happened to her, she left no trace./Stan the woodcutter went outside to get to work, but his axe wasn't where he left it; he found it nearby, buried in the skull of a man he's never seen./A pair of local businessmen (the butcher and the baker) have been acting very strangely after a night of drunken revelry at Madame Biggs' brothel./The barkeep at the Oldtown Tavern swears the glasses keep rearranging themselves, and the barmaid saw something disturbing when tossing out the scraps in the back alley./The secretive Steelmoon Academy was founded on the site of an ancient monastery a few decades ago. Pupils who were admitted to the school had never returned to their families. Last month, one did return.../This morning, the locals found that the ancient oak tree standing in the center of the village is dead and burned; no one heard the crackle of flames nor felt the heat from what must have been a massive conflagration in the night./The captain of the watch brought the mummified eye that was around one of the graverobbers' necks back to his office along with several other items that might serve as evidence. Yesterday morning when he arrived at his office, he had found the eye had rolled off his desk and tucked itself into a corner of the room. This morning, the eye was in the same corner and a ghost was rifling through his desk./After a night like any other night, a well-known alehouse is broken into. The burglars managed to locate the hidden safe and crack it open. Not a single coin was taken despite there being several hundred. The only item stolen was the owner's only copy of a centuries-old recipe for brewing golden ale./Campfires have been seen at night in the ancient stone ruin. A local farmer went to investigate and found nothing. The following day two boys went to play among the ruins and they never came back./The King has been murdered while at his summer palace from the capital city. He is dead of a knife wound in his own bedchamber. There does not appear to be any forced entry and the guards posted saw and heard nothing. The palace's soul gatehouse reports that no one came or left the palace last night./When her favorite patron, a member of the City Guard, stopped coming in to see her at the urban tavern where she works, the barmaid was a little disappointed. When someone left a purse with her name on it containing 5,000 gold pieces, she was shocked but cautiously accepting of it. When someone left a purse with her name on it containing a severed ear, she panicked./The high brother of the Storm King's Temple of Winter has been found dead on the temple grounds. The freshly burnt-down candles, the half-eaten supper, and the open books and notes on his reading table suggest that he was interrupted while taking his evening meal alone in his study. The immediate cause of death is unclear, but his lips have been sewn together neatly with fine silk thread./On a thin strip of land separating two bodies of water , only a mile and half wide, sand continues away from the beach stretching across the land and connecting two the opposing beach. No trees or plants grow here, just a 100 yard wide desert bridge across the land./On the road between here and the capitol, just off the road, a giant three fingered fist carved from some magnetic stone juts from the ground./Someone or something is enlarging Farmer Greenbrows sheep to 3X their size./A large old gnarled tree in the forest has a special property: when someone touches a gold coin to the tree, the sound of a 1000 swords unsheathing echo through the forest./In these woods is a well maintained grove of trees of many different species. Some shouldn't even be in this climate. one trait they all share is the faces that rise out of the bark. All the faces maintain the look of peaceful slumber. All except for the very last tree, which bears no leaves, it's branches ending in scorched limbs. The face on this trunk is frozen in a scream of anguish./Its like a statue or something. I guess it makes you procrastinate, I'll describe it better later./Instead of hearing the ocean or the sound of the blood in your own ears, once a day this conch emits a mundane conversation between a family.

There are more women than men. There seem to be no young men between about 18-23 years old./Out in the mountains; people out and about on daily errands -- frozen in place, some mid step; unmoving and unaware./The children sing a strange little rhyme. Everyone knows the words and no one knows where it came from. Probably from some long-lost wet nurse. Why then does the ruling council cringe when they hear it? And who is the foolish king the rhyme tells of?/This outhouse seems shabby on the outside, but inside it smells of mountain air and meadow flowers. A washbasin seems to fill itself and waste and feces seem to disappear down the hole./Out over the ocean there's a massive cloud that doesn't travel exactly with the wind. Staring at it sometimes yields a glimpse of something glittering./A local slang word can't be heard by men or boys./Recently when the sun goes down in the city, food and drink acquires a peculiar aftertaste./Walking around the grounds outside, the East Wing of the mansion is much larger than it seems on the inside.

Or are they?/A library as large as a city once existed, containing all the knowledge of the sentient races. However someone lost the map and now its nowhere to be found. How did they lose something so important?/In a small valley there exists a war that never ends. Those that worship the sun against those that worship the moon. Why does it never end? They are all cursed with immortality. Yet people keep attempting to murder the kings. who would do this and why?/Lots of people come in and out of town on a regular basis, but there is always someone who, despite whatever else they have going on, stands at the gate and watches the horizon. This watch lasts anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, but the watchman or woman is hardly ever inconvenienced by taking this time. It is almost never the same person, rarely is it anyone who seems ready for combat, and they take their watch almost without missing a step, like they came to the city gate just to stand guard. No one ever speaks while on this watch, but they do pay attention to the events unfolding around them. Anyone touched or attacked immediately snaps out of this watch and is normally aware of whoever shook them from their watch. No one ever has a clear reason for why they are taking watch, just that "they thought they might have seen something"/Screams are heard in the middle of the night, random body parts growing bigger during the night. This invites the worst kind of tourists./Anything can happen on the mountain, as long as nobody is not looking./An order of shoes arrive in town with buyers names and 'prices' attached, all of which desperately in need of shoeing./A half (literally) woman appears at night stealing still pregnant women' unborn children.

All of the locals are afraid to venture inside - not because of dark magic, or the undead. Legend says that the tomb itself plays pranks and tricks on all those who enter./Upon first glance, this is a completely normal village. The local people don't talk much, and stay away from strangers. But come night, all of the citizens retreat inside and board their doors and windows. Come night, the undead come. These undead don't seem violent, and don't attack the party, all they want is inside the houses. Upon further inspection, these undead look an awful lot like the exact citizens you were just talking to./The legendary stronghold of Woodfort has never been breached, despite being built out of wood. It was said to have been built with an extinct magical kind of tree, and cannot be burned or easily broken. But nearby, the surrounding forest has slowly been dying over time - ever since the fort was built. Legends say the forest used to house all kinds of Fae, but none have been seen in a very long time./This miniature horse is beloved by the townsfolk. They stop short of worshiping it but it is included in all major social functions and gatherings. Nobody can explain the appeal of this miniature horse, and outsiders can concoct no explanation for the enthusiasm and loyalty shown by the townsfolk towards the animal./While travelling through a stretch of forest, adventurers pass through many small valleys where the ground is damp and the foliage is dead. Wherever they go, a swamp seems to block their path. When they backtrack, they find a swamp where there was none./Upon entering the village, one notices the air is still and there is strange dust covering nearly everything, even the people. The villagers claim many of their kind simply vanished and they are unable to leave the village grounds - they reappear on the other side when entering the nearby woods. The adventurers go to the nearby river past the tree-line and find an old dock with a shack and rowboat. Across the river is the exact same shack and boat, imperfections and all. Heading across the river, they find the exact same village mirrored and all the missing people from the first village./While travelling, the adventurers sometimes find themselves in a nearby place with no recollection of going there, often out of breath & with their weapons drawn./In a small village, a mother has just given birth to her 7th, but only child; the first died at 1-month, the 2nd at 2 months, the 3rd at 4 months, the 4th at 8 months and the 5th after a year and a half & the 6th after 3 years. The 7th child is now 5 years old and looks identical to all the others. It also seems to remember the lives of its lost siblings./Last week, we made some resurrection and chosen one plot hooks, so it seems fitting that for this batch of mysteries we visit the supernatural and the strange. The plot hooks themselves suggest a way in which the story could move forward. In contrast, a mystery should lead the story astray. There need not be clear direction as to where a mystery may be heading. The mystery doesn't necessarily have to be solvable at all, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs. I'll post a few examples./The monks swear there is a helpful ghost lurking in the brewery. They attempted to drive it out twice before, only to have dozens of barrels of ale drained as they aged./For centuries astronomers have watched the Red Wanderer and the Morning Maiden as they cross the sky. This year, their paths would cross for the first time in record.

No one in the village knows whose ship it is./Deep in the Haunted Forest there is a small clearing along the road covered in what at first appears to be tall grass. On your approach, you'll see that what you took for grass is in fact a patch of hundreds of long, thin tentacles, gently swaying together as if caught in a breeze./There is a singer named Bertram who often performs in the Customs Plaza by day and at the Cat and Goat in the evenings who sings the loveliest duets, taking on both the high-pitch and the low-pitch parts, making both voices harmonize from his golden throat at once. When asked how he manages both the low and the high parts, Bertram insists with a smile that he doesn't sing the low parts, his infernal master does. If you ask to speak to his infernal master, Bertram laughs and lightly says, "What master?"/The best bakery in the city by far is The Faery's Child, an idyllic little affair on an out-of-the-way back alley. They've got a little something for everyone, it seems. The proprietor, a lean, middle-aged elven man, is perfectly warm and welcoming, and only too happy to hand out samples to new customers. There's just one problem: nobody has ever seen anyone deliver supplies to make the baked goods he sells./For one day every fifty years, every piece of currency and every gemstone in the country begins to rapidly transmute itself. Diamonds become turquoise become rubies become quartz; gold coins become coppers, which turn into platinum pieces. Trade becomes either impossible or completely possible; the more conservative merchants will close their doors to avoid being taken in, while the risk-takers will speculate and gather as many of the rapidly changing coins and jewels as possible. At the stroke of midnight, however, the transformations stop. Many a beggar has been made a rich man by the contents of his alms cup... and vice-versa./Smack in the middle of a bustling town square is a place where nobody seems to walk--because there's a ship there. At least, it feels like a ship; while one can feel the planks and grip the anchor chain, to all observing eyes, the thing is invisible. The fact that it stands straight up while on land is a somewhat lesser miracle./Tales tell that the king's daughter has the most beautiful golden hair. Tales are right; her hair is actually made of spun gold. Needless to say, she is kept under lock and key in the castle, and every ounce of shed or cut hair is whisked away to the treasury before you can say "exploitation." One evening, a member of the party receives a letter by raven, pleading for rescue. There is no signature, but inside the folded paper are three strands of the finest gold./A renowned purveyor of bespoke ettersilk clothing owns a four-way mirror that reflects only the most flattering angles and poses. Lately however, some customers report seeing long-lost relatives lurking behind their reflections, aggressively wielding long knives./The tower of an abandoned church has regular nocturnal visitors that make no secret of their comings and goings, but the local village is hesitant at best to acknowledge it./Soon after receiving shipment of soul silver jewelry, the scale in Pyfford's Fyne Goods gained a new, unlabeled dial that only seems to change when used by certain members of the community, most of whom seem just as baffled by the addition as Dame Pyfford herself./A farmer digging for peat in the moors near his farm finds a buried door that opens into the parlor of a shady vampire-staffed gambling house a continent away./After smoke from a forest fire turns the sun and moon blood red, local children start to mark ashy third eyes on their foreheads and will only speak in whispers./On the anniversary of a devastating cave-in, the runecog ore carts that had been lost within the mine trundle up from the deep, overladen with blood-stained ore./Hrothman Togg is a pious man if there ever was one, and he keeps a clean establishment that caters to Clerics, Paladins, and other men (and occasionally women) of the cloth. Imagine his surprise when his daughter, a beautiful young woman, reveals that she's pregnant, and she doesn't know who the father is. Even more concerning to the community, however, is that up to a few days ago, Hrothman Togg didn't have a daughter./A wealthy baroness has accused her staff of stealing the silver, and the local guard has been called in to handle the matter. What starts as suspicion quickly becomes confusion when it becomes apparent that the entire staff - supposedly nearly three hundred people - is actually one man in a vast array of costumes./And now for the puns! When the local women's Turnipball team grows ill right before a big game, their coach (and manager) is at wit's end. After a truly inspired pep talk, he gets them onto the field... but within minutes both teams are doubled over in pain. Now most of the league is sick, and the men's teams are refusing to play./A small time hustler comes into possession of a staff that greatly increases his prowess in just about everything, especially billiards. Unfortunately for him, the staff is sentient, lawful good, and loudly repeats private conversations at the least convenient times./(Part of) a missing nobleman turns up at fishmonger's quay after a particularly large tuna disgorges his signet ring, still worn on a severed finger. The bereaved family requests it back, and after a short period of mourning, the nobleman's son is named as the head of the house. Spectators at the event can't help but notice that the son now sports six fingers on his right hand, one of which is sickly white, pale, and wears the family signet./A poleman on a garbage barge is swept into the river during a flash flood, and is saved by an aggregation of manatees. Now, several weeks later, he feels a strange urge to bathe in the brackish water of the bay, eat aquatic plant life, and headbutt boats. Even worse, his normally athletic physique is quickly becoming rotund, and his skin has become a rather unattractive gray./The moaning woman by the fountain that everyone walks past has a drawing of a young boy's face. It's her boy, Danny, and he's missing. Everyone has given up hope on finding him since he disappeared, but not her. This boy is everything to her, and now her husband, daughter, and best friend all won't speak to her anymore. Why?/The Baron of these lands set a Hunter to the task of ridding hid hunting wood of a terrible thing that has killed those unfortunate enough to happen across it. Some are found with terrible teeth marks, others with wide, horrible gashes. Many are never seen again. And the Hunter has been gone for three weeks./The civil war between the Knights of this land and their forefathers, a paladinic order of tyrannical good, was only a Generation ago. But why can't anyone remember it clearly, or speak about it in detail? Do they fear plainly saying it, or have they really forgotten such a thing? How could they have naturally forgetten?/The PCs come across a recent battlefield. Long enough ago that most of the bodies are gone, but arms and armour still litter the ground. However, none of the locals know about any battle, there are no stories about it, and the coats of arms and banners are unknown in the area./Once a year a strange hooded figure poles a boat onto a certain dock. There is always one person who goes over to board it. Witnesses might say they looked afraid, relieved, or befuddled. The boat leaves, and that person is never seen again./An apparition of a huge dragon appears whenever there is a lunar eclipse. It acts out the same scene each time - a titanic battle against an unseen foe. Finally it comes to rest at an abandoned plot of land where there are some ruins, and nothing grows./There are stories of a merchant you meet on the road, with a covered wagon decorated in painted vines and scenes of frolicking pixies. The merchant offers you a sale of a wondrous item, then, whether you buy or no, will ride on, vanishing when you look away for a moment, although you can still hear the hooves of the horse. Bad luck comes to those who see the merchant; if they buy, the item will doom them, if they don't, they find themselves in a situation where only that item would have saved them. Some say there is something you can say to the merchant that will make them leave you in peace./The Crown Prince has vanished from his rooms at the palace. Nobody saw him leave, and no divination has found a trace, either of him or foul play. The only thing left was an exotic rose not from this continent and a note saying "We must talk" in elegant handwriting./The baker in town makes the best pies. The best. Everyone loves his pies. When people ask for his recipe, he just taps his nose and winks. Why are his pies so good?/One of the PCs wakes up one morning with a stone in their shoe. The stone turns out to be a flawless diamond, with the hint of something glinting in its depths. From time to time, people will come up to the PCs claiming the diamond is stolen, but when they see it they will go pale, give it back, and it isn't the diamond they were looking for./The skies turn blood red one night, as if blood were flowing over the dome of the sky. Everyone is talking about it for months later, even monsters who would otherwise simply attack the party./The local children have a communal imaginary friend, it seems. The "Bunyip" lives in a local ox-bow lake, in a small piece of abandoned ground near the village. The Bunyip occasionally takes the children to his underwater house, they say, and gives them presents. The presents appear to be sea-shells, which is odd, given the sea is many miles away./There is a local cave - not particularly mysterious until now. People used to shelter in it from the rain, or camp there when travelling to the next town. However, yesterday it suddenly changed into a carved likeness of an unknown monster with a huge, gaping maw. The locals would quite like the PCs to investigate./There is a forest of impenetrable Blood-Thorns. On dark moonless nights, what appears to be lights in a tower can be seen, about a mile into the thicket, on a hill./Last night, all the portraits of the current king on all the coins of the realm changed to a hideous shrieking skull. Even the dies in the mint changed./The day before Harvest Day, one field in the village appears to harvest itself overnight. It's always a different field, and seems random. No matter how careful a guard is placed, one field is always harvested without anyone seeing how or who./Every dragon or draconic creature seems surprised to see one of the PCs. No matter what they were doing, as soon as they see that PC they will start, and look at them with astonishment. "It can't be..."/At noon everyday for one week of the year, a bright light can be seen blinking at the top of a cliff miles away. It looks like a reflection, but nobody knows what's causing it./At the same time every afternoon, every child in this small village becomes incredibly lethargic for ten minutes or so. It is possible to keep them awake, but they all try to sleep the duration. The town has grown used to the effect and treats it as part of daily life./Deep in the woods, a creature is rumored to subsist entirely off of unwary travelers that it catches with its worn rope hands. According to the locals, there was an overzealous hangman many years ago, but no one knew what became of him when he was accused of treason./In the fall, trees in the King's Forest lose their leaves. Instead of standing bare, however, they grow fluffy grey down, then luxurious feathers as the winter progresses. It has been this way for centuries./Rekbar Otis is one of the land's greatest merchants. He has sold sand to camels, ice to vikings, and now, he's trying to con the good people of Randrenvale out of their gold with a miracle tincture. This time, it seems like it could be the real deal.../None who come through the Bard's Pass, the only route between two mountain villages, emerge unchanged. Every living being that comes through the pass leaves with a newfound appreciation for music and a freshly tuned lute./Out of the blue, dark red spirals appear wherever the players are. They seem to be organic in nature, twitching, breathing, sometimes even screaming. Their sudden appearance only seems to be noticed by the players, though. The pillars seem to have a weird effect on townsfolk and other figures around though. Nobody seems to be willing to acknowledge their existence, even when interacting without. "Okay, so you're seeing the pillars, right?" "Yes." "And you're still saying they don't exist?" "... Yes"/Next to a small town there is a cave that leads deep, deep into the hills. What lays at it's very depths is unknown, however, as seemingly every twist and turn people make them end up outside again, leaving through the very entrance they came in through./There is a cathedral where a mythical creature resides. Some say it's a living anvil, with teeth and a tongue that devour every adventure that nears, others claim it's a demon possessing the shadow of however enters, to kill it's owners. In all reality, it's a Suprise Elemental, a monster that without form, without reason. Only appearing when nobody is expecting it, always in the form that's least expected./Rumors of hauntingly beautiful music carrying through the night have been cropping up around the town crypt. All of the townspeople who claim to have heard it seem happy to discuss their lovely new nighttime lullaby./Recently brawls at the local tavern have increased in their frequency and ferocity. People once known to be jovial, mellow, or sad drunks now turn on their friends with abandon at night. Curiously, people known to have a temple while drinking have now simmered down, and all involved seem unaffected during their daily lives, aside from nursing their fresh injuries./The town's loggers refuse to travel more than a league into the forest, but the lumber they return with is far too dense to be young growth, and it burns with an unusual ferocity.

Depending on the patron, this could have several win conditions: an Archfey could expect total obedience, but step in to stop the sacrifice before it's completed; a Fiend could watch and laugh as the sacrifice is carried out; the Great Old One might revel in their mental distress, or even expect them to flat-out deny the demand. In any case, they are rewarded for "passing the test."/A suitably powerful angel delivers a summons to the Chosen One: due to their unwavering commitment to justice, they have been called upon for jury duty. They and the party must pack up and leave for the high heavens to sit in on the trial of an angel who may fall from grace./Suddenly, a dragon! The dragonborn (or Draconic Bloodline sorcerer) of the party is singled out, as the dragon in question is their great-great-great-grandsire, who has grown too large to fit in his childhood lair and needs someone who shares his blood to help clear out a band of looters and cart out the treasure to be relocated. As the quest progresses, it's clear that this is not, and really never was his lair./A small humanoid fire elemental asks to be freed from a containing vessel. Once free she may give the party a reward (e.g. a fire ruby witch can be consumed to throw a Fireball or sold as jewelery). She them appears in random fires, such as torches in a dungeon, to talk to the party or give them a small, strange task. Once the players prove their value and her trust she asks them to help the fire kingdom in the elemental plane. The elemental convergence, an event that decides which element will prevail over the others in the material plane for the next 10 thousand years, is near and war is imminent. Plot twist: even though she keeps saying that an era of fire would bring life, light and warmth to the material plane the truth is that no element ever wins the convergence and this is what keeps the material plane balanced. If an element gets an edge over the others terrible things happens on the material plane (a fire era would more likely bring firestorms, heat the planet and start a vulcanic apocalypse)./The party encounters refugees that were helped out of the Underdark by a Drow. They want to save others that were left behind./One of the party members is spoken to by a God while they were sleeping. They foretold that 3 great demons, Behemoth, Ziz, and Leviathan would soon awaken and ravage the lands if the party doesn't stop them./The players arrive at a town where everyone is on edge following the discovery of headless townsfolk outside town. No one knows what's causing the rash of headlessness, and the town guard would really appreciate it if the adventurers were to figure out why it keeps happening. While investigating, the party finds a fancy hat that looks like the hat a lord or lady might wear. How it got outside of this poor farming town is a mystery. There are no signs of magic on it, and it looks and feels just like an ordinary hat. Unbeknownst to the party though, a clutch of young mimics live in the area, and have learned the neat trick of looking like a hat causes people to pick you up and put you on their heads so you can then proceed to bite their heads off. Is one of the party members HEADed for disaster and decides to put the hat on? Will they discard it and then wonder why townfolk's heads keep disappearing? What will they do when the clutch becomes brazen enough that a half dozen or so "hats" line the road?/Due to a recent famine, many of the townspeople have been eating dog meat just to stay alive. Soon after, many have heard of large packs of dogs ambushing travelers outside town./A town that was promised protection from a giant in return for food, has gone back on their deal and refuses to help feed the giant. Thanks to all the protection, the town has deforested the surrounding lands with farms without contest. Because of this, the giant is beginning to starve without anything to hunt, so he has begun stealing cattle from farmers./The town royalty (king, duke, lord, etc.) is looking for someone to help cure his son from a very terrible curse. When his son is exposed to the sunlight, he shrinks to the size of a copper piece. The local wizard says he can only be cured if said royalty gives up all his gold./Along the road when traveling, the party encounters a small gnome with an enormous backpack nearly 4x his size filled with all sorts of knick-nacks, and trinkets. After offering to sell some of these small interesting items, he asks the party if they would mind finding a long lost treasure he has been seeking called the Coin of a Thousand Sides. This coin, when turned over, may appear to be any currency the holder desires./Along the road when traveling, the party encounters a lowland covered in tar pits. In the center of the lowland there is a dwarf stuck in the pit. Every effort to get him out is futile. He asks the party, as his final wish, to enact revenge on his brother who lured him here and pushed him into the pit/One morning when the party awakes from a long rest, a party member realizes that they are not the gender that they were before. Inside his backpack he finds a note that says "Drink from me fountain, and ye may become a man or woman again." The note also has a crudely drawn map that points to a small fountain with a badly drawn goblin standing next to it./A celebrated Dragonborn cook has gone missing on the eve of the spring festival, and the local baroness is at wits end to either find the poor sot, or provide a suitable replacement. To complicate matters further, a series of portents (the appearance of a blood-red star, the blossoming of a long-dead tree in the castle courtyard, the water in the ancient fountain in town square belching forth what appears to be blood, etc.) matching an ancient prophecy foretelling the return of a threatening (but vaguely defined) foe has the local churches and peacekeepers on edge, and some of the more influential townspeople are calling for the cancellation of the festival altogether. Others are hesitant - apparently this is far from the first time the spring festival hasn't gone to plan./A village has a stone tower that serves little apparent purpose, and mostly serves as a place for teenagers make out away from the prying eyes of parents and village elders. Recently, however, a large vessel of foreign design has appeared daily, descending from above the clouds to dock with the top of the tower for an hour or two before ascending back into the heavens. The blacksmith's daughter - a wilful creature - left on the ship two days ago, and hasn't returned./The Thrice-Crowned Emperor has grown old, and his advisors are beginning to worry that the long-delayed discussion of who (or what) should succeed his centuries-long rule will come too late. Noticeably mum on the subject is Thirteen, the last(?) of a series of mechanical servants created for the Emperor in his youth, and closest advisor to His Eminence. Long-silenced rumors have resurfaced that the Emperor's livelihood is directly tied to the wellbeing of the automatons, and the reactivation of long-defunct factories beneath the palace have spurred speculation that not all is as it seems./A Mysterious Necromancer comes to your party asking for aid in exhuming dead bodies from the local cemetary. It is unclear what he needs the bodies for but he is offering to pay you with what your heart most desires./While imbibing at a pub in town, your group finds a note on the wall from a local farmer asking for help with undead roaming his fields in the night and destroying his crops. Upon talking with the man, he believes something in the crypt on his property is stirring the dead. He is offering your group a hearty meal and drinks, and whatever you find in the crypt is yours to keep./Upon entering the town that was supposed to be camp for the night, your party discovers that the town is completely empty. Seeing a light in a church nearby, your party investigates. They find the entire town residing in the catacombs under the church. The party learns that the town has been terrorized nightly by a mysterious beast that eats children, soon the towns population of children will reach zero and the town will wither away unless your party can slay this mysterious beast, whatever it may be./Long ago, before Human Civilization emerged, the dragons ruled the lands. The evil king of the dragons ruled with no care for any of the other races. His ultimate goal was to exterminate anything not a dragon, anything impure. The Dragon was killed by a lone adventurer, inspired by the death of his love. Thousands of years later, a cult has emerged, seeking to resurrect their king, and they are on the verge of success. Will they be stopped, or will the Dragon King rise again?/Someone is drawing the local citizens in unflattering ways, such as the local butcher chopping up local children with the caption "You dannae expect me to pay for real meat, do ya?" and posting the pictures in various places around the city. The city guard can't seem to catch the rapscallion, and now the city is offering a nice sized reward to whoever can catch the culprit. Can the party determine who the jolly joker is, or will they instead find themselves the caricaturist's next subject?/A known grifter and confidence man has been arrested after breaking into the magistrate's private club and declaring his guilt to all assembled, describing at length everyone he's ever swindled, cheated, and or or hustled. He also implicates your party's (rogue or fighter or warlock), claiming that they were partners in all of it./A hag has terrorized the fens North of Glynnflldych for as long as anyone can remember, stealing lambs from the farmers and making strange demands from travelers passing along the fen road. The village tolerates her, mostly because the hag keeps the local bullywugs at bay, but a trio of brothers demanding her eviction have rallied a growing number of locals to their side, and they're looking for some muscle./There are rumours of "The chosen one" or "The returned one" or whatever it is that the party's "Special Butterfly" is. Only it's someone else. Some other person is running about gaining fame on the PC's gimmick. The PC may get flak for something they've not done, or suffer scrutiny they don't want if they're mean to be a hidden heir to the kingdom. Is this "other chosen" a fake? The true heir or chosen one? A doppelg?nger? Is the PC the doppelg?nger?/The party find a Lich at the bottom of a dungeon, and defeat and contain it, although they are unable to permanently destroy it. Amongst the Lich's treasure are things marked with a specific coat of arms. If they investigate, they will discover that the lich was actually the heir to the kingdom, thought lost and dead some centuries ago - and technically Lichdom doesn't count as "death" as far as the laws of succession are concerned.../There is a massive shift in the spiritual world. Clerics of a specific god - including one of the PCs - find their spells have changed overnight - almost as if their god's domain had suddenly shifted. There are other strange signs. Statues or images of their god start to corrode, rot or crumble away. The signs and portents of their spells change. Instead of ravens as messenger spirits, bats. Instead of green flames, blue. Eventually, the PCs learn that somehow this god has been killed and replaced. An epic-level adventurer climbed the difficult path to the heavens and usurped this deity. Can the PCs journey to the Underworld and retrieve the slain god? Or will they throw their lot in with the newcomer? Even if they do manage to resurrect their god, will they be changed by their time with Death?/The party is wandering the roads, when they encounter a minstrel troupe, who ask where the party is headed. No matter which way they say they're going, the troupe says they're headed in that direction as well, and could they travel with the party as they're feeling a little nervous since the mercs they were paying to guard them, betrayed them instead and ran off with the troupe's money. Even if the party refuses them, the troupe will follow them closely, when confronted, they will admit that they're scared the mercs might come back and finish them off, or some other menace might get them. So, by staying close to the party, they hope things will be scared off. That night, while the party sleeps, the party member(s) on guard will find themselves suddenly attacked with a concerted barrage of mesmerize, charm, sleep, or other mind affecting spells. It turns out that the wandering troupe is actually a traveling group of Were-rats, who do this regularly to adventuring parties, caravans, merc companies, etc. Can the party survive the were-rats treachery? Alternatively, if your players are too suspicious of the troupe, you could change it so they really are a minstrel troupe that has been treated badly by a merc company, and that merc company is coming back that night while the groups are camped to finish the job. Let them get all fearful of the troupe, and then surprise them with the mercs instead./Haphazardly pinned to the inside of the tavern door and seen on their way out is a torn piece of paper asking for help with vermin harassing a local farmstead. "Could be .. (the pages is smudged heavily here). Paying well for help! They are ruining my fields!"/A priest or priestess had been tasked with guarding a special item until their deity's chosen one arrived to claim it. Well, the chosen one has finally arrived but the holy guardian has already given the item away, very recently! What could have caused the mix-up? Maybe the false prophet used trickery to gain the guardian's trust, maybe the guardian was confused or biased, or maybe there are multiple "chosen ones". This adventure could end with the party reclaiming the holy item or meeting and recruiting the additional chosen one./While slightly drunk, one of PC hooks up with some beautiful woman. Next day, he gets an invitation to duel at 7 am in front of the town./Out of nowhere a wild and dangerous troll appears. But he is only dancing because magic shoes force him to do so./Out of nowhere, giant river springs in the middle of the city, destroying all of it. Local wise man claims only great magic or portal could create such river./An extraordinary huge ogre destroyed a small village and some nearby farms. But he only wanted to play.../While travelling, they hear a call for help from a nearby field of crops. There, a young farmer is being attacked by a Blight. After saving the farmer, she offers the party a visit to a local fairy spring in exchange for helping to find why her crops have gone mad and started biting. This sets up to a fight against a large Blight or evil Treant./Water coming from the well has become increasingly red, and has picked up a distinctly metallic taste. This, combined with the increasing rates of disappearing villagers has the locals worried/Rumors of eternal life have bounced around for as long as anyone can remember. But only recently has a once-great and now exiled theologian posted a reward for it. He even claims to know of its general whereabouts./The local miners think they've found something dangerous. The further deep they go, the worse the symptoms get. It starts with a rash, and general aches and pains, and moves to internal bleeding of the lungs. Recently, a cave - in was reported, and when the bodies were finally recovered, they were covered in red, swollen boils. Everyone is afraid to return, and some think the source is magical. A local wizard is interested in the truth./A bishop from a long forgotten city has appeared in the history records at a bards college. Legend tells of it'd magnificent beauty, and hints at its magical prowess. It seems that after the bishop received the ring from the "One True God", he was able to communicate directly with the diety. An order of paladins wishes to recover the artifact, and will pay a handsome sum to anyone willing to explore the ancient ruins./It seems that on a large, remote, and tropical island, one Lizard folk is in the mood to unite the tribes. He has taken to slave labor, and is currently constructing a pyramid for him to reside inside. The main - landers fear the uniting of the tribe, and want him buried in his tomb as soon as possible./The party encounters a revenant whom they recognize as the recently deceased king, who supposedly died of natural causes. The king's successor is only a few days away from his coronation ceremony. Something seems to prevent the revenant from revealing the real circumstances of his death./News of a shipwreck reaches the ears of the party. This ship however was built to house a huge magical weapon and is now available to whoever gets there first./The soldier in a small castle has been possessed by a demon, and he is told to overtake the castle in the name of said demon. He poisons the ruler and the ruler falls into a coma. The soldier starts recruiting any and all bandits or trouble makers that find their way near the castle, and begins his attack on the castle./While entering town, the group is accosted by a one-eyed man who asks the adventurers to get his eye back from a wizard who stole it as a spell component for some new spell she was researching. The only problem is that she's traveling with a company of Mercs, who don't take kindly to someone troubling their company mage./A local rare frog breeder has been deliberately poaching wild frogs so that he has a monopoly on the lucrative hallucinogen the frogs sacreet./On a barren plain, a deadly Bone Naga has been terrorizing travelling caravans. They are sick of this snake and so they resort to contracting the party to hunt it down./Rumours of The Nightman circle the town, saying he is starting a cult on the outskirts of town. The Nightman is a nocturnal monk that said to be a master of martial arts. He has cat like eyes that he uses to peer into people's dreams, corrupting them, causing a wave of nightmares through the populous. Whether these rumours are factual or not, a cowardly noble has put out a bounty on The Nightman./In a small forest town, a general store has been burgled by bandits. The vindictive owner now feels powerless, so he decided to train until he is ready to take the down the bandit camp himself. All day he runs through the town, silently, leaving his store closed. The town needs his store to open, but the owner just keeps running./In a largish city, the party is invited to a secret, underground Fight Club "Club for Fighting" that has recently started up. The only problem is that one member won't stop bragging to his friends, which is explicitly against the rules. The party is asked to resolve this./In a small farming town, the nights have become unseasonably cold and stormy, affecting the crops. The townsfolk point to three white dragonborn sorcerers, who have all only been seen while in the presence of the area's vicious tax collector./Awaking sore and disgruntled, the party finds themselves locked away in prison on charges of murder and a number of petty misdemeanors. The penalty for murder is the noose. The party must convince the grizzled old magistrate of their innocence and follow their midnight murderous meanderings to uncover the truth./On their adventures, the party stumbles upon a fork in the road. Splitting to the left is a road worn with years of travel to a well known port city. The other path appears brand new and untouched. Mysterious lights flicker in the distance./A string of killings occurs in the local village. Every morning a body appears in the square horribly mutilated by numerous small blunt objects. Despite attempts to catch the culprit, the town watch reports never seeing the crime happen or having fallen asleep at their post. At the scene of the crime is always a duck with a blood crusted bill./A pair of wealthy looking gentlemen can be seen having a good-natured argument as they travel down the road. Recognizing the party as adventurers, they bid the heroes settle a matter from their own "wilder youth". One believes the treasure they sought in a nearby ruin was never there to begin with; the other is sure had they been more skilled in those days they would have prevailed. They are no longer interested in the treasure, but who is right./Near a farm at the outskirts of town, the heroes encounter a single emaciated goblin. The pitiful creature is clad in a single rag, and the lash marks it bears tell of its time as a slave. The goblin and its tribe have been conquered and enslaved by the local village. The newfound peace and extra workforce is allowing the settlement to boom./After a very merry night with some traveling gypsies, the party awakens to find that according to some vague tradition, they have adopted one of the gypsies. It is now their responsibility to take them into the wastes as part of their coming of age ceremony./The only local ruling families to ever keep their hold on the throne had heroic bloodlines. The baron and his wife have the wealth, political skill, and connections, but not a drop of heroic blood. It is a well known rumor that any adventurer who can gather some fame with their exploits will spend time in the lap of luxury as a court concubine. Then again, I did only say the baron's family seeks to add heroic blood, didn't I.../A man near crippled by old age begs for your help. He tells a story of how he was a chosen sacrifice and his youth was stolen. If the ones who did this were dealt with, he would become a child again. At least he thinks so. See, the problem is even magically aged old men have trouble remembering things, and now this chosen one isn't that sure on the details.../You've just finished looting adventuring in that old crypt when you are approached with a reward you were most definitely not expecting; an arranged marriage. Turns out that old king had a habit of speaking in metaphor and a court wizard who took things literally. "A commoner will marry into this family when he pries the rings from my cold dead hands!"/Rumors abound, whispering of one rising in infamy just as quickly as your own glory grows. They appear to be your opposite in nearly every way; tactically, morally, physically, only the same in power. Is it coincidence, or prophecy? Whatever it is, this antithesis of yours seems to be drawing closer./First post wasn't on topic, so I'm back for more: Of course, not all resurrections are made equal. Sometimes the plant reagents have gone bad, or the wrong ones were picked. Sometimes the person had been dead for too long. And sometimes, like this time for instance, part of the characters soul was invaded by a parasite upon reentry into the physical world. Slowly, she loses the spark of life. She can still move, still talk, and is as strong as ever, but her voice has gone flat and her appetite has disappeared. At first you thought it was some sort of depression, but then last night happened. Out of the blue, her magic stopped working. The high counsel of wizards suggest you kill her again, and capture the soul as it leaves her body. This way, you can separate host from parasite, but of course, this is a dangerous, and risky process. And hasn't been tried for many centuries. Books will need to be dug up from ancient tombs, and long lost reagents found. This'll be a long one, but your characters very soul is at stake. Better act fast before there's nothing left!/Well, it turns out it depends on the diety. Some are more than happy to oblige, but others, the darker gods, want to keep what's theirs. And they punish those who would try to steal from them. And this one happens to do so by raising the dead. If you can take what's his, he can take what's yours./Since birth, you were told you were the chosen one. The ultimate mover and shaker of the centuries. Only - now you've lost your one-ness. It seems that you've been possessed, and this creature, this seed, this thing inside of your mind, digging and burying itself further inside of your consciousness, thinks that you're not the chosen one. It is. You find yourself acting in your sleep, unable to remember what you've done. Sometimes it takes over during the day, and you can't come close to fighting its power. It acts in ways you would never imagine, and seems to be planning something against your will. It pushes you to accept quests, and reject others. All with one thing in common: blood magic./Resurrections aren't easy you know. They're expensive, and a time consuming process. And it doesn't always work. But you've heard tell of a cheaper way, Cloning. A wild outcast of a tinkering gnome thinks he's found a way to clone living tissue. All he needs is a spell which will extract the memories from a living being. Such a shame that the only wizard who knows of such things is evil, and living at the top of a tower a long, long way south./That's what Elbert asked himself while studying his ancient tombs over 40 years ago. "Isn't necromancy giving life to what is already dead? And shouldn't they do what I bid? I was the one giving them life. I was the one who put purpose back into their cold and rotting corpses. It's a small cost to pay, and I'll free them eventually! All I have to do is find a way..." Or so he told himself. 40 years later, and he's hidden himself away in the catacombs, surrounded by the dead, and all alone. He believes that he can fracture the soul of a living person, and give it to the undead. Little does he know, he's making a lich that MUST be stopped./Inside a busy town, the party is robbed by a passing vandal. Following a small chase scene, detailed with the typical cart dodging and stall vaulting, the party will catch the thief in some dead end alleyway. Palms up, swearing no trickery, the thief will return the party's stolen belongings. The thief will also helpfully forfeit some of his other stolen wares as well. Returning to the market place, a well armed group of guards will stop our merry band of adventurers. "In the King's name, your are charged with breaking into the high vault of the Royal Treasury. Stand down, criminal scum, and accept your punishment - death!"/The Prince or Princess has never left the extent of his or her kingdom, and is interested in learning about the faraway lands detailed in his or her history books. Of course, the King and Queen hardly want to see their precious child runaway into certain danger. The Royal Child is offering an ample sum for the party to take the prince or princess as an additional member of the party. Be warned, however, should the Child encounter any danger and not return unharmed, the wrath of the Kingdom will fall against our fair adventurers./Sailing throughout the Seven Seas, there lies pirate band, pillaging all that they please. The watch has been called, a bounty is set, the whole kingdom moves to oppose threat. Yet, fair adventures, know this to be true! Beware of their captain, else he'll run you through! A bard of wicked rhythm, a rapscallion musician; He'll crush any pirate hunter's foolish ambition!/A merchant from a distant city has arrived, swathed in acres of silk, and has managed to simultaneously undercut and outprofit nearly every fishmonger on the quay, seemingly overnight. No self-respecting angler will admit to selling fish to the foreigner, and the local guild is considering artificially inflating the price of seafood so that other merchants can compete. More troubling, several of the waterfront's resident urchins or couriers or pickpockets have gone missing, and reports of dark shapes in the water have caused the watch to establish ban on swimming./The sudden reappearance of the Warlock Prince after almost twenty years abroad has the arcane networks abuzz, and hedge wizards, hermit sorcerers and socialite bards alike have been invited to attend the ceremonial recrowning. Conspicuously left out? Your (wizard or warlock or sorcerer or bard or cleric)./Simultaneously, every creature in every facet of existence hears the same plea - "The Planes are Dying! Woe! The Planes are Dying!" - followed by an empathetic barrage of every emotion conceivable. It's over almost before it started, and only a select few are able to stop gibbering for long enough to parse the meaning of the message./After a long day on the road, the party settles in a small, lively inn. As soon as the party's bard starts playing (or, if the party lacks one, the local fiddler), a beautiful, yet eerie woman starts singing strange lyrics to the melody that describe a way through the local country side to an abandoned house and end with the words: "Party Face's Name found the lone hound's hall  or  and recognized it well  or  and by the very last breath's call  or  they ended the demon's spell". The mysterious singer cannot remember anything, but will repeat the words when the tune is played again./In the middle of the path ahead of the party lays the body of an old man, with a large gold coin clutched in his cold hand. At first glance he seems dead, but once any one of the adventurer's touches the gold coin, he rises into the air with glowing green eyes, as the coin fuses with the palm of their hand. A booming voice emanates from the old man and informs them that they are now cursed to carry the Coin of Mammon (Demon of Greed) until they too die. With this the old man crumples to the ground in a heap. On further inspection of the old man, a map is found, the destination of which merely says "Mammon"..../A mother and child rest at the side of the road suckling on sweat soaked bandanas. When they see the adventurer's they ask for water and tell them about a curse that's been laid on the town just up the road. The river flows with fresh water but when the water enters a person's mouth it turns to sand. A local coven has cursed the town for breaking a deal with them./A covered mirror, found the by the party, turns out to be magic. It shows a glimpse of the future (based on the character's background) by altering the appearance of whatever is reflected in the mirror (this can be the appearance of the character including physical features or clothing or equipment, or the surrounding location). Characters roll a d20 to determine how good or bad what they see is (the lower the roll, the worse, and the higher, the better). At the end of their vision, a second d20 is rolled to determine if something they saw (such as a scar, wound, armor, or location effect like a building behind them being on fire) is permanent in the real world (10 or lower, something is permanent, 5 or lower ensures it is something bad, a critical 1 requires it to be a serious injury, and a critical 20 provides a powerful boon). One character sees a vision of himself shattering the mirror. Any attempt to shatter the mirror fails - it cannot be broken by any standard means./The city is abuzz, as word has spread that a great and world famous chef, Riordan Gamsy, has come to the city and will be cooking a meal for the king. But, in order to cook this exquisite meal, he will need exclusive and rare ingredients procured for him, and sure enough the kingdom hires the PCs to acquire said ingredients. The list is full of hard to obtain ingredients, such as a moss that only grows on the bodies of zombies, and the meat of a Bullette, etc., you get the point. But, after gathering all these ingredients, and bring them to Chef Gamsy, he has to admit to the PCs that he doesn't actually know how to cook very well. He's a con man who just kind of stumbled into this gig of being a world famous chef. He makes lists of ingredients that he knows no one in their right mind would ever gather, and lives off the generosity of the king or queen or etc. while waiting for the ingredients to be procured, and then when they fail to procure the ingredients, he gets huffy, says he will not compromise his art, and then moves off to the next kingdom. No one has ever been able to get all the ingredients before, and he doesn't know what to do now, as this lord will actually be expecting him to create a mind-blowing meal with the ingredients the party has gotten. First he'll beg the party for help, but if they refuse he'll threaten the party, saying that if they don't help them with his situation he'll tell the lord that they were in on the scam as well, and they'll all go to the chopping block together. What does the party do?/A stranger comes-a-calling, and requests to speak with the PC's late great relative of some kind. PC explains that relative has been dead but you recall hearing stories of Aunt or Uncle stranger name, yet they look as though they haven't aged a day. The stranger is struck with WoE for with as many years they've spent on this plane, they often forget the passing of time. (Family Friend is either Revenant or Vampire or Lich...etc.) They came to call upon your deceased relative because they require aid. Perhaps the PC will be willing to answer the call?/Old King Zac has no trueborn children. So when he dies, agents of the kind arrive in your far-flung village, and reveals that you are in fact the long-lost bastard son of the king! However, the old king got around. There are dozens of other bastards, of all ages and races, half-orc, half-elf, tiefling, aasimar, oread, undine, plain old human, dhampir, on and on. The king's ministers declare that all of his heirs shall vote to choose the heir to the kingdom from amongst themselves. A vote shall be held at the end of each day, until one heir holds a plurality of votes. Murder of your half-children disqualifies you on the spot. Go! Compete with your half-siblings for the ultimate power in the kingdom! The king's will demands it!/A mage covered deep in cloaks and his two guards ride up to the party while they travel and ask if they can join until [name city]. He does not want to pay or anything and will ride in silence behind the party, even his guards seem very silent./Every peasant parts way as this group of three nobleman's sons walk through with their personal guards. A young street kid does not see them in time and falls to the ground when he runs into the middle one. This nobleman's son immediately challenges him to a duel and one of the others throws him a rapier, when he picks it up it is clear that he never used one. The guards turn away and form a haphazard circle./Early in the morning in this small hamlet the party wakes up from hush voices and the sound of rolling barrels. When looking out from the barn where they stay they see a small squad of goblins rolling in barrels into the towns center. When given time people from the houses come outside and walk up to them like it is no big deal and trade freshly found forest mushrooms for jugs of milk and pieces of woven cloth./When walking upon an off-road stone bridge between villages sits and old troll, he is singing and is drinking from a barrel. When the party comes close he demands wine and ale for the crossing. He seems very sensitive about the state of his bridge, he thinks it is beautiful./A street merchant stumbles up to strangers and asks if they want to buy special medicines, potions and charms.

Thing is, she has a wooden stake through the lower part of her neck, it looks painful and she can not fully turn her neck. Anyone ever heard of a Pointanak?/It is your normal Ogre hunt job, you get told where and when it will be anywhere and your job is to poke enough holes in it to make it stop moving.

But what is that, glistening inside this enormous wooden beam, a sword deeply embedded shining like the day it was made./Travelling through a thick forest, it starts to get dark but open spaces are rare.

When paying attention old remains of animals litter the underground, turned to fertilizer..../An old homeless man approaches the party looking for some spare food or change. If the party takes pity on him, he reveals himself to be a wizard that has fallen on hard times and grants them some kind of magical benefit for a short period.

He swears that someone has replaced his magical goods with "almost equivalent" versions - a bag of "sort-of" holding, a belt of somewhat useful items, potions of temporary healing, etc. The city merchant's guild is threatening to put him out of business for swindling customers, but he swears he's being set up./An eccentric wizard dies and leaves behind his tower.

This year, it's the bar maid at a tavern the PCs frequent./People are dying under mysterious circumstances in the capital city, and the healers & clerics can seem to find no cause for their deaths, as the victims just drop over dead for no apparent reason. Of course, what the town doesn't know, and the PCs are going to have to find out, is that an evil Lord has found a way using dark magic to resurrect the dead, but the cost is the life of another in the area. This Lord is currently busy in the catacombs underneath the city, using the dark magics to raise an army of the evilest, vilest, most loathsome individuals interred there, to help him take the capital, and the kingdom, and in the process he's killing the victims in the city above as collateral damage./A famous retired spy-master has been murdered by a gang of apparently random bandits, and his famous amulet of scrying is gone.

Upon inspecting the arrow the kings men tell you that the arrow is dwarf made, but the feathers come from a rooster. You heard earlier that a shipment of arrow shafts and heads got stolen from the Dwarfs and there is a town nearby called Roost where everyone is a chicken farmer. There they can find a man called the cockslayer who slaughters old roosters. He must have supplied the attacker or attackers with the feathers for their arrows./He does tell you that all the victims have been seen attending the noble parties of the Blackbriar history society./Two dragons have been known to slumber in the ruins of an ancient city for a long time. Aztorkin or Venom, the Green Dragon has been breathing his toxic fumes into the old sewers of the city for many years, to make sure no one can attack him from below. Kartharnix or Acid, the Black Dragon has slumbered for long on the other side of the ruined city. He has many slaves under his command which he sends into the sewers to mine the green hardened resin of Venoms toxic breath. Acid has figured out that when he slowly melts the resin with his acid it creates a vapor that fills him with ecstasy. However recently Acid learned that his neighbour Venom had been slain some years ago, and when his slaves informed him there was no more resin to mine, the dragon went insane. Supposedly he now tears the city apart frothing at the mouth, melting stone and steel in search of his fix. Soon he will direct his anger elsewhere, if he is not stopped./A recent flood seems to have had an effect on the swamp surrounding the local lighthouse. The lighthouse keeper has filed complaints that the Bullywugs living in the swamp have gone from their usual bumbling selves to an organized terrorist group!

The lighthouse keeper warns that if they are not stopped they might become a serious threat./You find an ancient coin that looks nothing like you have seen before.

A lot of things have gone missing near the old Gnome wizards house. Not a lot of people go near it since the old gnome was found mauled to death in his laboratory.

A few people have gone missing too and there have been reports of weird noises around the old house./You are starving and parched from long travel without nourishment. Walking into the first tavern building you see, you notice immediately how empty it is, and the innkeeper greets you enthusiastically, talking your ear off about a story you never asked for. As he gives you food and some time passes, you notice the wood slowly warps, cobwebs appear in the corners, and light dust has made its way onto the surfaces. As you finish your meal and make your way out, you find that the innkeeper is nowhere to be found, the doorway is boarded up, and the inn appears older than your grandfather's grandfather./A logging camp has been abandoned by its work crew, who refuse to go back to collect their equipment, or even personal belongings left behind.

Despite his zombie-like appearance, his benevolent attitude has earned him the favor of the (less conservative) peasantry./One of the merchant ships in the dock is long overdue on it's berth fees. Nobody has seen the skipper in weeks but he declared a lot of valuables when he arrived at the city.

The stories of a monster in the deeps were only campfire tales to frighten children... or were they?/Last week a successful business shut it's doors, leaving hundreds of locals out of work.

His master gave him life - or something close to it - but all he feels is an absence that cries out to be filled.

Tedd the barkeep greets them warmly. Nilla the barmaid smiles knowingly as she sways around the bar to bring her favorite heroes their usual libations. Halfway through the first round of drinks, the party members start to feel a bit dizzy. Tedd trudges across the barroom and says, "I had no choice. They arrive right before you did. I'm sorry." The bar is now crowded with crossbowmen in mail, wearing purple and black cloaks./Gethers the one-eyed, grotesquely fat boss of the Dead Mouse Gang with whom you've worked before dismisses the pair of lackeys that accompanied him to meet you here at this pub.

We've stayed out of it, but I'm running out of smugglers. I need you to find the mole."/After enrolling in a tournament of skill, agility, and strength at the behest of their mysterious sponsor, the party discovers that nearly every challenge has been rigged against them.

But when a steeplechase across town ends in the tragic deaths of a beloved noblewoman and her lover, all signs point to something more sinister./Old Heddy has for years been the go-to gossip for up to date news on the goings on of all aspects of life in the city. For the price of a drink and a little ribald conversation, she could be relied on to dispense a juicy tidbit or two on who may have been seen stepping out with whom, and what dock may have received a secret shipment of godshit. But when the party attempts to pay her a visit in her customary corner of the Heron's Bill, she hisses, spits, and gives them the evil eye; the bartender - a wise man - advises they run./A struggling restaurateur has hired the party to do the unthinkable - sabotage his competitors. A renowned critic of all things gastronomic is in town, and the poor chef's only chance of receiving a favorable review is to shine in comparison to his peers.

When they arrive at their first destination however, they find that the poison isn't just putrid - it's deadly./When a notorious Viscount betrays the party, it comes as no surprise - already wary of traps and duplicitousness, they make their escape from his mountain manor with ease. But many months later, while traveling through a port city, they're alarmed to find a wanted poster hanging from the door of the inn, the windows of the shops, and in the hands of the sheriff's deputies. To add insult to injury, the list of supposed crimes verges on the ridiculous, including things like 'Theft of the Crown Prince's Dreams' and 'High Treason Against the Unified Tonalities of A Flat Minor'. Nevertheless, the local law seems intent on prosecution, and the only alibi they have rests on the word of a man who has already betrayed them once, and seems likely to do so again./A small group have been hunting a certain animal or magical beast to extinction, and willing to threaten or kill the druids trying to protect their land.

The party has been ordered executed, and the order comes straight from the Crown./A fearsome knight in black armor approaches the camp at night, unarmed and asking for parley. Upon interrogation, he reveals that his master, the cruel king of the neighboring realm, is planning on slaughtering the firstborn of every household. While he would much prefer to kill the adventurers and be rid of their meddling, his honor demands that he seek the help of the most able to avert this atrocity./The youngest son of a noble family hires the party to find and kill a witch who has been warping the minds of the populace. Upon further investigation, the girl is not a witch, but in fact an ex-fiancee who spurned his advances when she learned of his own delvings into the black arts./The Horses Replacement is one of the rowdiest dockside inns in Brightbluff, so it's par for the course when a group of rough looking half-orcs invite the party to a drinking contest. The drinks go down easy but win or lose, they'll be drunk and tired by the end of it. Unfortunately for them, the bitter old ex-cavalier who runs this establishment has a deal worked out with the half-orcs and their accomplices, and a discreet set of tunnels under each room wind their way right to the water and their boats. Passing out at the inn, they'll find themselves miles out to sea and suddenly the newest unwilling crewmembers (or slaves) aboard ship./While traveling in the forest, the floor suddenly collapses beneath a member of the party, and they narrowly avoid being speared by the ranger hiding within the pit trap.

Can they besiege their own fortress?/The avatar of Death appears to the party, and tells them he will be taking them all during their next dungeon. Buuuutttt, he will give them a pass if they help him recover his steed, which has been stolen by one of the other Horsemen. The problem is that he doesn't know which of the other Horsemen has his stallion, and so Death expects them to approach each of the other Horsemen about it. Of course the other Horsemen won't just give up info about the theft, the party will have to figure out ways to make the Horsemen cooperate./A wealthy town has a detachment of Golems that are used in the town defense. A squad of mages builds and maintains these automaton guards. What these mages don't know is that one of their apprentices is in actuality a powerful mage for the opposing side who has managed to make sure during the creation of each Golem that there is a command word embedded inside them to allow him or her to take control of said Golems when the time is right. Such as when the opposing side has an army outside to take the city mayhaps?/The party arrives in a city where the King is away on a crusade, but the Queen is still around. They party goes about their business, until after a day or so, they realize that people are starting to stare at them and speaking in hushed tones behind their backs. Sooner or later the party will discover that there is a rumor floating around that the King has taken a lover while off on crusade, and has now sent that lover back to the kingdom for his or her safety. Of course, one of the party members is that rumored lover. Who's behind these rumors? Is there a secret lover trying to shift blame to someone else?

And what will happen when the Queen hears of these rumors?/The party are resigned to a week or so aboard The Dowager Bride, working their passage across the Mirror Sea to the Outer Isles. The Captain, Morrun Jake, was loath to take them but has agreed eventually on account of the Bard's sea shanties or the Cleric's blessing or the Wizard's knowledge of Arabay legend, or somesuch. The deal is struck in a dockside bar, after a long spell drinking with the Captain, his first mate, the Bosun, and the Purser. Every day the sun shines, the sea is calm, and the wind is good. Every evening includes a spell at the Captain's table for at least some of the party, eating, drinking, telling stories, gambling a little. The rest get to break bread with the ordinary seamen. In between some work swabbing decks, stitching sails and repairing the rigging, the party has ample time to heal up, learn spells, swap stories, and practice weapons skills on the deck with various interesting sea-dog types. Friendships are made, and maybe some friction too in places. But a quiet interval between adventures is just what the doctor ordered. Until last bell on the third Friday at sea when Black Pete the Purser and Carter the Bosun slit Jake's throat as he sleeps and claim the captaincy. The crew are split and it looks like it's going to get ugly. With the party having good relations with some on both sides, how will the they play it?/The party is currently fleeing danger, they conveniently come across a friendly person who offers them refuge to avoid their pursuers.

Once they have given enough the healer will ask for sacrifices, such as pints of blood and pounds of flesh./As the party walks down a road they're approached by a single -apparently unarmed- shady looking fellow, he asks the group if they're in for a quick buck. Once they agree, the highwayman will tell them that a caravan of merchants is due to pass by that same road in a matter of minutes or hours, but he can't take them on alone. Once the PCs assault the caravan, the "merchants" reveal themselves to be bandits, partners to the shady fellow./Have a minor henchman idolize someone in the party, he will mess up once in a while but that's because he's clumsy. The first moment the party starts causing mischief he will sneak out one night and offer guards info on the party in exchange for money./A young person claims to be a medic and it's searching for some herbs to make a cure. He does "warn" the group about the dangers they're about to face. Each time they come back the medic needs yet another (more dangerous) reagent for his cure. The "warning" could be something like: "Be wary, the leaves of X plant might be poisonous in a large enough dose". But he conveniently omitted the massive cloud of noxious spores the plant segregates when threatened./A very liked NPC (usually young) who follows the party has his or her own goals, after following them for a while that person realizes that reaching that goal won't come soon. Have a different band of "adventurers" appear as a rival match for the party, eventually making the protege/The party encounter a lone young dandy, Joraldo Callico, on the losing side of a drunken fist-fight with a hulking stevedore, Henk. Joraldo, love-lorn and in his cups, had made the mistake of lustily insulting the Scheffer family scion, Konrat Schefferson, within earshot of Henk. He works for the Scheffers. Most of the stevedores do around this part of the docks. Turns out the Callicos (southern hosiery and silk scarves) and the Scheffers (furs and leather from the north) have a long-standing and bitter mercantile feud. But Joraldo, a relatively unimportant young nephew of his family's current head, cares about the feud only in-so-far as it prevents him from marrying the love of his life, Kirstel Scheffersdotor, youngest daughter of Konrat himself. He shows the party the letters she has sent him, and describes how she is practically kept prisoner since broaching the subject of marriage with her father. Her last letter implores him to free her so that they can elope together. If the party can unite the lovers at the Crocus Inn by midnight tonight, they can have a barrel of Callico gold and as many silk scarves as they can carry, plus Joraldo's undying thanks. Springing Kirstel is a big job, and fraught with danger, but, assuming that they successfully deliver the beautiful, doe-eyed, love-struck girl to Joraldo and his surprisingly large retinue in an upstairs bedroom at the designated rendezvous, he will be overjoyed, handing over the reward and thanking them profusely as he suddenly drives a serrated dagger up under Kirtsel's ribs whispering, "Callico honour! Death to Scheffer dogs!" into her shocked and pain-twisted face. Whatever way the subsequent events immediately unfold ... How long will it take before the Scheffers get their revenge? Where, when, and how will it manifest?/At a ribbon cutting ceremony for a newly funded home for aged out adventurers, the keynote speaker Mack the Medicocre, has been turned to stone.

The party has to find some of Mack's old enemies and recover the scroll so he can be turned back to normal./The party receives a contract from the Thieves' Guild to recover a particularly rare jewel, on behalf of an unnamed noble who is sponsoring the contract. The next day, the party's rogue (or the least trustworthy member) is contacted privately by the guildmaster's lieutenant. If the rogue will secretly return the jewel directly to the guildmaster, with the other party members none the wiser, he can collect the entire payment for himself. Will he take the chance? What if the lieutenant offers a path to promotion within the guild? How will he pull it off?/In light of a recent catastrophe, a well-known public figure declares extermination of a minority (tieflings work best here). PCs need not be the minority, but works best if they have emotional connections to the marginalized/A bard shows up in a town pushing an Organ (or whatever large musical instrument suits your fancy). He attempts to solve the issue of hunger in the town by playing an extremely fire beat, which somehow magically produces food within the instrument itself that can be retrieved and consumed. However, this act of generosity raises the ire of F&B business owners, especially when paying customers start flocking to said bard for free, better-tasting food./Vistaru, Lord of the Mountain, is attacking small towns surrounded by his kingdom in hopes of expanding his army before his assault on the capital./Locals hear chants in the nearby ruins./Someone in the party is secretly a half-wolf/Undead threaten cities across the nation./The queen has been assassinated./A large gang or terrorist organization wages war against a local city./The party comes across a gladiator stadium and is offered money in return for fighting./Dragon blood is needed to cure a plague and your group is sent to collect some./A powerful bard hires your party to retrieve a fabled magical instrument from a dead wizard's coffin./Breaking into a dungeon or room or fortress etc. to rescue or capture a person or artifact./Safari; characters must hunt down a creature./Mysteriously, an entire city has lost its inhabitants overnight./The characters must chase escaping bandits through the countryside or are chased by bandits through the countryside./Discovering a portal to another plane leads to an exploration party./A medusa is constructing a garden of statues using townsfolk./Statues in a large cemetery come to life at night./A lich is raising a massive undead army./The party finds a small cursed object (marble, figurine, ball bearing) which keeps multiplying every day.

For added fun you can have them face a challenging monster, who leaves them the choice of fighting, or diving down that unknown tunnel that goes even further underground and leads to potentially even more danger./Drow slave work party made up of a mixed group of humans, orcs, and half orcs. When rescued, many turned out to be evil themselves or suffered from Stockholm syndrome./Basilisks turn their prey to stone, with their supernatural gaze, and them consume the stone. They can be trained, if raised in captivity from an egg. Have your adventurers face off against a basilisk and its master in an underground cave./Behirs lair in hard to reach locations such as deep pits, high caves in cliff walls. Have a behir attack from ambush in one of these locations, using the ceiling and walls to its advantage. For a social encounter, have a very full behir decide to aid your adventurers somehow on their way to face a powerful dragon./These iconic floating spheroid aberrations dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings. Set a beholder in its lair where it gets access to ambient magic for an even greater challenge./Drow who have failed Lolth in some way can be turned into these twisted creatures of madness. Surround a drider with giant spiders (CR 1 | p. 328) for a tough random encounter in the Underdark. Add in some spellcasting abilities, if the drider was a spellcaster before being transformed into a monstrosity./Cloakers are usually found lurking alone in dungeons and caves. These stealthy aberrations are named for their resemblance to a dark leathery cloak. By the time a cloaker moves into attack and reveals its white underside, it will already be attacking with bite and tail. Cloakers also have a fear inducing moan and the ability to create illusory duplicates of itself. Have your adventurers interrupt a rare conclave of multiple cloakers for a tougher challenge./Mind Flayers are psionic tyrants and slavers usually found in the Underdark. They are magically resistant and are natural psionic spellcasters with the ability to detect thoughts, levitate, dominate monster and plane shift. Their abilities and lawful evil alignment make them naturals to create an empire on the backs of mind-controlled slaves. Also called illithids, they are the evil at the heart of many adventures. Bump up a Mind Flayer to a deviant Mind Flayer Arcanist for a higher challenge./Minotaurs have the ability to perfectly recall any path they have traveled and live to ambush your party as it enters the labyrinth. A minotaur cares little for tactics and will recklessly attack and charge, leaving itself open to counter attacks by those that survive the onslaught. Place one of these savage monstrosities at the center of a labyrinthine set of tunnels or some other maze-like environment./These massive monsters burrow and chew through solid rock in pursuit of its prey, which is anything it encounters. Purple worms are attracted to noise and can be used as a big surprise interruption for a higher level group fighting an easy battle. A purple worm (or multiple worms) can also be a source of a complex network of tunnels. Defeating a purple worm can be a good time for you to drop some serious treasure on your players as these worms are usually quite filled with precious metal and gemstones, especially if they are hunting in a mine./These savage and loathsome humanoids can be found in the shallow depths of the Underdark dwelling in filth. Nearly their entire existence is devoted to gathering food. Have a group of troglodytes hunting your lower level adventurers, looking to drag them back to their lair as food.  Have any adventurers who are knocked unconscious in a battle dragged away to be be eaten unless rescued by those left standing./Looking for food, umber hulks will suddenly tunnel into a cave or burrow into the wall of a passage and wait for your adventurers to pass by. Umber hulks have a confusing gaze that can scramble the mind of those within 30' that look at its eyes. Set an umber hulk at the center of a mystery of disappearing explorers or miners to set-up a tough encounter for lower level adventurers./1d6 of Aarakocra flying above, scouting for the temples of elemental evils/An angel flying to a nearby city. Could be a herald of hope or doom.../A Fallen Angel, disguised as a hermit, poses a series of morally intense questions to the party, hoping to learn of their moral compass... Perhaps seeking validation for his or her choices, perhaps continuing with their unending moral guidance. If the latter, he will forcefully interrupt when they answer in a way unfavorable or \"wrong\". The former will lend him or herself well to a much more pleasant experience./A Deva approaches the party, disguised as a random creature. Roll 1d6. 1:Humanoid, 2: Dog, 3: Bear, 4: Bird, 5: Mouse, 6: Golden Snake. Then, roll a d20. If the result is 1-3, the most pious party member receives a task from their God. Upon success, they are granted the single service of a Planetar (CR16). For all other numbers. The Deva brings a message of hope, deliverance, warning, peace, reward, or anything else relevant. Most likely from the God it serves. Perhaps it simply brings advice good for the party, or help for them. If one player adopts the animal, when they are in trouble he or she could revert form (CR10) and kick some ass. At the very least, help or heal./A suit of freshly animated armor (CR1) approaches the party, eager to earn its marks. Feel free to grow in some Monty Python quotes as the party chops off its arms and legs. Remember, someone enchanted this armor.../1d3 Ankheg (CR2) burst out if the ground surrounding the party, prepared to eat them alive! Most likely to happen in a place where the Ankhegs don't have easier prey around. Alternatively, the Ankhegs could burst upward to seize a party pet or something of that nature./Roll 1d20. On a 1-3, they see an Azer (CR2). Roll for an ideal (p.90 DMG). They are LN./A Banshee (CR4) approaches the most attractive member of the party or the most Elvish and fawns over them, for their beauty - not jealously, but lovingly. Doting, almost. It wishes for the party member to spend its life with it, so that it can gaze upon the PC's beauty every day. If the PC refuses, the Banshee will become enraged. Players can make a CHA check to let it down easy, DC15 to get it to not attack, DC20 to get it to be okay with this and follow the party member to the end of its territory, and a DC30 to help the Banshee come to peace, and releases it from its curse./The party comes across some petrified (to stone) wild animals, indicating that there might be a Basilisk (CR3) nearby... /The party comes across a \"messiah\" who attempts to convert them to an up-and-coming God./A guard patrol passes by, asking if they are in need or immediate assistance. If the party is in enemy territory, they are instead attacked./A wagon train, 2d8 cars long, passes by. They are traveling to a nearby city and the party is given the opportunity to join up and ride along with he train. However, as they're asked, the train won't stop moving! They'll have to hop on to get on, if they want to (DC10 DEX)/The party comes across an extremely primitive tribe of 3d12 hunters or gatherers of any race (all one race, however). Could go anyway. They'll have a certain number of trinkets (PHB) and 1 useful magical item (DMG). The party could take it, trade for it, whatever. However, they don't speak a \"known\" language, but they do speak *a* language./A husband and wife pair of hunters, fully decked out, one of whom is a Druid, pass by the party on their way to a magical forest to hunt some animals that would be a true challenge. Bring up a lot of survival of the fittest, it is our duty to hunt the weak so the strong can thrive, bullshit. /A group of 2d8 + 8 homemade militia men (like a town's militia) on their way to go kick some bandit ass. They're docked out in some not-exactly-high-grade gear./A group of 2d4 blights (any variety) led by a single Vine Blight (which are capable of speech) carry with them, in a beautiful wooden box, a single Gulthias Tree seed with which they hope to create more plants in service of their master, the Demented Two./1d6 bugbears ambush the party, in an attempt to prove who is the strongest and most deserving of becoming chief. The first few will fight to the death to prove their strength but the last few will flee once they drop to about 10HP. /They come across a large amount of moved earth, even uprooting the path, all swirled around. There is no clear path to the moved earth. Unbeknownst to the party, there is a Bulette (CR5) underneath who will attack them once they come within 60 FT. /They come across a lone Bullywug one the back of a large snake, who is lost and trying to find his way to the nearest swamp. He is dressed up like a king, but comically and ineptly so. More like a bum playing king for a day. He will give the party a random item from Magical Item table E on pg.145 in the DMG if they can pass a DC10 survival check to give Jim directions to a nearby swamp./A cambion (CR5, spawn of Graz'zt) disguised as a normal human male (brown hair, green eyes, very average features) attempts to sow disharmony throughout the party. Probably by requesting the party's escort and fucking with them along the way there. If the party catches on and attempts to kill him he will fight, but flee if he is in danger of dying by using his Plane Shift spell. If he dies flee successfully, he himself or a greater demon will get revenge at some point later on - at the DM's discretion./A lone Centaur comes across the group, seeking to trade the sword of its family (magic: +3 , use PG.142 DMG) in exchange for directions to a nearby village or city./A wounded, old Centaur seeks protection in travel to the nearest settlement where he might live out the rest of his days./They come across a dead Chimera, with its three skulls each cracked open, and a small item from Table D, pg145, DMG./The party comes across a Cockatrice (CR1 or 2). It is curious about them and will not do anything to attack them, unless there is \"any hint of danger\". If there is, it will go insane and attack them viciously. Otherwise, it will saunter off after a few minutes or perhaps go after a nearby mouse or some other small creature./They come across a small magical bush, with 2d4 small glowing blue berries. If ingested, the berries grant the ingested invisibility for 1 hour or until they attack or cast a spell. Berries lose true magic 12 hours after being picked, and all picked berries regrow at the middle of the night./A soft and beautiful tune is carried on the wind./6 Stirges swoop down attracted to the night campfire or the smell of blood/3 Hungry Ghouls stalk the party until they lunge for their snack/An Ogre feasting on the body of a halfling/6 Goblins dancing in celebration/5 Hobgoblins are searching for the Adventuring Party./4 Orcs scouting on behalf of a larger war party./4 Wolves hunting a deer/Large patch or hill of flowers/Squirrels chasing each other/Something stirs below the water's surface/Birds of prey circling overhead/An earsplitting squawk/A shadow passes across the ground/Smoke rises in distance/Deja vu/Many thousands of ants crawl/Howling or barking in the distance/Patch of vines strangling a tree/Skeleton of an animal/Skeleton of a humanoid/Writing carved into tree/Large patch of brightly colored mushrooms/Few scattered and broken arrows or bolts/Snake slithers away/1' hole penetrates the ground/Rainbow in the distance/Group of bats rise in the distance/Tree falls in the distance/Broken, rotted wagon wheel/Bear tracks/Deer tracks/Wolf or dog tracks/Unusual patch of very lush growth/Sudden sun shower/Wind kicks up/Dead, rotted, burnt, headless troll body/Giant mushroom grove/Discarded, tattered cloak/Rusty weapon/Dark storm cloud approaches/Large beetle buzzes around head/Large boot tracks in mud/Dug, shallow hole/Remnants of old campfire/Sandstorm/Small dust whirlwind/Puddle or nearly dry watering hole/Few sun bleached papers/Large bird (heron) seems to follow you/Stack of rocks piled high/Giant feather/Sweet smell of honeysuckle/Small pond/Bog/Stand of birch trees/Stench of feces/Ray of sun light hits tree or bush/An unusually cool breeze/Couple of rats are following you/You get a dull, throbbing headache/Injured woodland creature lies helpless/Skunk smell/Eerily quiet/Field of dead trees/Humanoid statue (flesh to stone)/Stung by a bee/Arid dust coats your mouth/Odd crystalline growth/Ogre skull/Abandoned shack/Very friendly skunk/Wild boar/Wild horses/Find a copper piece/Caterpillar or grub-infested tree/Coyotes fighting over a kill/Mother bear protecting cubs/Hatched eggs below abandoned nest/Large insect moult/Something scurries away (chipmunk)/Patch of berried bushes/Large splatter of bird droppings/Old, rotted horse carcass/Large tree with face image in bark/An oasis/A rusty suit of armor/Active bees nest/Howling gust of wind/Approaching lightning storm/Crow squawks repeatedly on approach/Disabled wagon with nearby dead campfire/Disheveled shrine or grave marker/Rats are rummaging through PCs' food/Cloud of insects moves across path/Rocks falling in the distance/Pair of small birds harass PCs/Feral cat trails the party/Large animal crashes through the brush/Cloud shaped like a holy symbol scuds out of sight/Shopping list for potion is found/Old ring sticks out of the dirt/One person's ears begin to ring/One person has an intense itch/Hawk takes mole or mouse near party/Stick-figure voodoo doll(s) found/Tornado/Earthquake (mild, moderate, or severe)/Great toppled tree, roots outstretched/Creek bars path/Fern-filled clearing/Beaver pond or dam/Rocky outcropping/Ancient snag filled with tiny holes/Carpet Of spongy moss over large area/Cave or large den/Groundhog colony: big holes, mounds of dirt/Tree with bark chewed or clawed off the bottom/Picked mushrooms laying on stump to dry/Sentry animal (probably bird or rodent) raises alarm/Burned area (trees standing, no undergrowth, all black)/Fool's gold sparkles in the dirt/Huge spider's web/Huge stick insect or mantis moves into the foliage/Pleasant voice seems to chant on the breeze/Fish bones/Punctured waterskin or flask on path/Forgotten dagger jammed into stump or earth/An Owlbear attacking some adventurers (who die from their wounds)/An elk, with two arrows in its neck, lies to the side of the trail.

Two nearby giants ask the group if they'd mind stopping for a while and being a part of their chess game, as they're missing some pieces. /A surly man with a crossbow sits at the mouth of a covered bridge, the only river crossing for miles. He offers to guide the group safely through the short, straight, empty tunnel of the bridge for a fee. /A ranger stops by the group's camp one night and gives them advice on the trail ahead, places to camp and a tavern where they can get good rates if they mention his name.

Some try to quickly leave the scene while the brave and curious continue to wait for the PCs' approach. /An old man in outdated-looking armor approaches the party on horseback.

So dense are these heads crowded together that should the party attempt to pass through, the heads assault their ankles and feet with bites. /A great number of frogs appear from the heavens and crash down among the party members. If examined closely, the party finds a gold piece in the belly of each frog. /A great green djinn sits dejectedly upon a rock alongside the road. When pressed or plied for favors, the djinn instead tells the party a story of his part in an ill-fated love triangle. /In a slight depression in the road, the party hears a sudden rushing noise, and looks up to see a seven-foot-high flash flood bearing down upon them. /The road leads through a tunnel. Halfway through, the party finds a major wall and roof collapse revealing a large passage running adjacent to the road, with flickering lights visible further in. /The road cuts through a mountainside by means of a tunnel. Partway through, an underground river has broken through to cut across the path, its strong current challenging your progress with roaring rapids in the darkness. /Uneasily, you pass a moonlit graveyard far out in the countryside. You travel in silence until a plaintive child's wail pierces the night, coming from among the gloomy tombstones. /You travel at night under a new moon.

None of their normal gear is missing but their items are strewn everywhere (perhaps an important quest item is missing). A search reveals tiny fey footprints all over the campsite, and fairy laughter is heard nearby. This side quest would involve no combat, but would be rife with traps and dangerous illusions that would cover deadly traps. /A crazy backwoods seditionist has made up his own country, with its own legal system and economy only he uses. He's a fairly powerful hedge wizard, and demands the PCs obey his laws. /A startled and disheveled merchant approaches and warns you to be careful of the road up ahead. He tells you a large number of locals have taken to harassing and, in some cases, robbing all who travel the new road that bypasses their town. Apparently, they are upset about the dwindling trade from people bypassing their town and have decided to take matters into their own hands. /The road becomes a crumbling spiral staircase that scales a cliff. /The road before you becomes paved with smooth, shiny cobblestones. A tremor runs the length of the road and too late you realize what you mistook for cobblestones are actually the scales of a giant serpent. /A leathery-faced farmer asks for help. He runs a successful bee farm and produces the best honey in the land...or he did.

Forewarned, you slip off the road and cautiously advance. It is then you find dragon tracks heading east, but strangely, after each dragon print lies a small puddle of oil. /A tree of local renown, the Old King, stands atop a nearby knoll. The ancient tree is withered and gnarled, but legend says the boon of the gods is granted to any who offer it a blood sacrifice. /You decide to camp not far from the roadside, but while setting up, a ghost rises up and tries to possess you. (If successful, the PC runs off into the night, leading the party to a cave-in that claimed the ghosts' life, hoping the party will complete his long forgotten quest and allow his spirit to rest. If the possession fails, he beckons the party to follow. If they do not, he flies into a rage and attacks.) /A couple has chosen a small glade along the road for their wedding. However, the bride is weeping and the wedding party is frantically scouring the grassy area, for it seems the ring has been lost or maybe stolen. /A disreputable merchant has set up a road stall that sells pies. Unfortunately, the pies are made with rotten meat, and whilst the pies taste fine, all who eat them become violently ill. /Outside the entrance to a silver mine, a group of protesters wave signs and shout racial slurs about dwarves stealing human jobs. As you watch, a group of dwarves entering the mine is set upon by some of the protestors. /A young couple feverishly digs alongside the road, bickering all the while.

You try to convince yourself that it is indeed animal and not humanoid that sits above the open flames. /A militia practices their ranging with a local catapult. For fun, a few decide to launch themselves into the lake beside the road. Looks like fun, maybe they are willing to share their new toy. /The road is lined with criminals chained to stocks, with only hands and heads poking through. A visible punishment for wrongdoers. Many of the criminals shout they are innocent.

The smell is putrid. /In the distance you can hear the music and dancing of the local brothel. Home to the most beautiful ogres and bearded dwarf women in the land. Take your pick. /Footprints filled with burning flames cross your path. Fire giant? /Large, strong arms wrap around a tree beside you and rip it from the ground, roots and all. /An ogre strides from the wilderness, offering his services as guide and bodyguard on a dangerous stretch of road.

The heated cups over the stove further suffused the air with it. Now, some days down the road from them and several washings later, you can still smell the sharp aroma upon your gear and clothes. /You notice three small jars sitting in the middle of the road. One is open. You also see a bloated body lying with its back towards you. As you approach, you hear loud buzzing from the bushes nearby. /A scraggly man sits at the crossroads. He offers dreams at a bargain price.

Eventually, the party becomes aware these are actually members of an opposing religion who plan to desecrate the shrine. /A naked minstrel asks for a lift to the nearest Inn where he left his clothes and money to pay for your troubles. /The PCs travel though an area suffering from a heat wave.

Or are they undead? /The party happens upon a simple steel ring that causes the wearer to switch to the opposite alignment. /The cemetery below the road is haunted by the tortured spirits of the murdered. On the full moon they rise up as skeletal aspirations and wraiths and terrorize travellers, pulling them into the catacombs below. /A small group of kneeling, lifelike statues, frozen in fear or supplication. /The road leads through a tunnel. Halfway through, the party finds a major wall and roof collapse revealing a large passage running adjacent to the road, with flickering lights visible further in. /A pack of five feral puppies eats a kobold corpse in a crossroads area.

Hidden threat: spearmen forcing the possibly panicking steeds and pack animals off the road, archers in trees. /While on the road the PCs come across a traveling merchant going the same way. The merchant asks if he can travel with them to at least the next village. During the night the merchant will attempt to steal from each PC.

Someone has recently carved a message into it in an ancient script. /Sharp rocks have broken off from a cliff and tumbled onto the open road. /An illegal logging or mining operates nearby. /You spy a chicken on one side of the road, looking diffidently at the other side. /A land mine lays in wait for the PCs. /A ranger stops by the group's camp one night and gives them advice on the trail ahead, places to camp and a tavern where they can get good rates if they mention his name. All his advice is good, but when they mention his name at the tavern, they're told he died years ago on that very road. /Shopping list for potions lies on the ground. /The King has enacted a toll bridge. Several peasants were unaware, and cannot afford the toll. They accost the PCs demanding then begging for change. /The road leads you to an icy arch traversing a deep chasm whose vertical faces dive down so far below you cannot see where they converge. The slick surface and stiff wind present a tricky challenge to your footing. /Scattered coins from a land you don't recognize shine inside the torn remains of a pouch. /On a bridge, the PCs hear the roar of water much louder than the river they cross. Then the river level drops. Sounds of combat upstream reach the PCs' ears. At the battle site, mercenaries are trying to capture a water elemental. The elemental is good-aligned and will appeal to the party for help. The mercenaries, if aided, will not split their bounty from the wizard who hired them. The elemental, if rescued, will reward the party with random treasures from the river bottom, but the PCs acquire the enmity of the wizard who posted the bounty. /A wizard rushes up to the PCs, running faster than a horse.

Something glints in the shadows. /A fat drunk bard sings praises to the gods. /The long mountain road leads to a tunnel. As it progresses deeper into the rock, it grows wider and develops a flagstone surface. At length, it emerges unexpectedly into an underground city. /A group of much more powerful adventurers meet the party on the road, heading back from a nearby dungeon. They brag about the monsters they slew and loot they found there, and say there's probably a few scraps left behind that weren't worth their time to pick up, if the group hurries. /Beneath the shade of a lone tree sits a messenger boy. He's exhausted and will tell every passerby he is re-considering whether he's in the right line of work. /Whoo-eeeeh, what is that? A terrible stench fills the air. The PCs must roll below their Constitution score or vomit. Dead bodies, a dead monster, whatever you wish, lie rotting in the bushes. /A cat wanders into the party's camp. It does not meow. It will eat if offered food, and may show appreciation with a little rub, but otherwise stays out of the way. It will follow the party for a few miles, and if ignored, it will leave. /Just off the road ahead, bedrolls surround a bubbling cauldron over a stoked campfire, but there's no one in sight. /Workmen replace a wooden bridge with a stone one. The detour is a day or more out of the way. The workers have finished a narrow path of stone, and might be convinced or bribed to allow you to balance your way across the precarious ledge. Watch your step. /A wheel breaks or comes off your wagon. /Your party hears a clatter of weapons and spirited invective before rounding a bend to find two men dueling about the roadway. /An elderly man sits patiently beside the road with a folding chess set.

One of them is still alive. /A man swings down from a branch and proclaims to be the god of predictability. /A cloud shaped like a holy symbol scuds out of sight. /A startled and disheveled merchant approaches and warns you to be careful of the road up ahead.

It's cheap! says a shady character while sneaking up on the PCs. (The price is cheap, and you might even lead the PCs to believe the ball works when they try to use it for petty things, but it is unreliable, maybe even cursed. And the big problem is that one or more groups of NPCs badly want this crystal ball.) /The dark forest the road travels through is home to giant spiders that drop onto the party. /An enormous rock blocks your path. /A band of rowdy centaurs camp beside the road, scaring away the peasants who work the nearby fields. /Army ants cover the road for the next 40 feet. /A crazy man points at a PC's equipment and lists its magical properties - and he's right! /The PCs encounter a cattle stampede.

The scroll says something important. /Crashing branches and undergrowth ahead stop suddenly as a young child bursts out in front of you. He looks wildly in your direction and pleads, "Help me please they're coming!" /A horse thief poses as a reputable merchant and strives to sell his stolen horses to travellers before the law catches up to him. /From the bushes you hear the soft sobbing of a small child. /A man steps from the woods and introduces himself as Captain Feeny. /A paved road recently rebuilt with stone from nearby ruins. The group notices some stones are carved with odd patterns. Put together, the patterns make up a mural showing the location of a valuable treasure or dungeon or great monster. /A huge, magical, glowing rock sits in the path. It hums louder when approached...like a bomb. /A cart filled with caged children rumbles down the road. /The warm rain that never seems to stop threatens the quality of goods carried by the travelers. /A hooded farmer struggles with a broken wheel on his wagon over-full of turnips. /A dead lion lays in the road, the victim of a swarm of wasps. /The sunken road is flooded out with blood. /A single stone has been recently erected in the center of the road. /Kobolds burst out of the forest in panic in front of the party.

On this side, the rope that guides the ferry is attached to a massive pulley, ready to ratchet back across the river. /Up ahead you see a young boy holding a sign and jumping up and down.

(The fortune could be nothing, or foreshadowing.) /A bandit steps out of the woods before you and demands passage (1 gold piece per traveler).

It's an ambush! /The party finds a number of bodies, hastily buried by the side of the road and uncovered by recent storms. How do they give these people peace? Or should they: perhaps these are the bandits killed by earlier adventurers, or the adventurers killed by bandits. /At dusk or dawn, you see a man-sized shadow from the left side of the road waving its arms at you. "Over here, quickly, I've caught one!" /Workers block the road demanding an increase in wages. /A giant sinkhole opens up right in front of you. /Two precocious children offer to buff shields or dust boots for money.

Contact with these stones leaves scorches and burns on any exposed limbs. They seem to be increasing in number as the road progresses. /A long line of refugees trudges along the road. /A troll is doing a poor job hiding behind the shade of an old oak tree. What is it up to? /A prey animal runs past. Is it chased by a predator? /The remains of caravan hide a traumatized child whose family was captured by humanoid monsters. /Not long after leaving a village suffering from drought, the party happens upon a blazing forest fire. /A person fleeing arranged marriage seeks refuge with the PCs. /Hairs rise on the back of a character's neck. It feels as if someone is watching them. Then they hear a whispered message. (For reference, the PC is on the receiving end of a Scry and Message cast through a Scry.) /A woman scolds her husband loudly as two tearful children look on. /A small man cuts grass with a sword. /The road through the forest is closed because the King is hunting and does not want the deer disturbed. /You approach a washed out bridge on a dry river bed. /The road is closed for construction. /A farmer with a slow oxen team blocks the path ahead. /A mob of mutated animals stumble onto the road and advance towards you. You can't help but wonder what caused these animals to undergo such an unholy transformation. /A man with many masks walks towards the party.

If you win, I'll grant you one wish, if you lose, no harm done and I'll be on my way." This man is a mimic, and all abilities will be copied by him. The way to "win" is to stand there for a few turns doing nothing. /A tree full of wind chimes. /A ranger chases after a talking frog. /In need of food and shelter from the elements (or from enemies), the characters come to a ruined tower full of revelling adventurers. But the Rules of the House say no one may enter until they have entertained the rabble with a rousing tale. /Mmmm, the sweet smell of tarts and pies fill the air. Right in front of you are the cooling pies and sweet treats nicely placed on a raised stone table. No gnomes, halflings or fairies about. Perhaps they would not miss a tart or two. /The PCs happen upon a shimmering pool. A knowledgeable PC might know the legend that says the pool is said to show an individual exactly where he or she shall be in two years time. /A toll-booth with guard and an official Inspector who wants to confiscate something strange or valuable. /Travelling freak show, filled with freaks, secrets, dangers and opportunities. /Picked mushrooms lay on stump to dry. /At the end of a long day's ride, the party looks forward to the comforts and familiarity of the Embridge Inn. But as they round the bend, they see the courtyard gate ajar and even more ominously, Kendrick the duty footman nowhere in sight. /A fortune teller's tent stands at a crossroads. /A rainbow bridge leads to some weird magical dimension. /A large barrel lies on the side of the road, guarded by a young boy and his slingshot. /Human footprints head off in one direction, blood with drag marks go in another direction. /In an arid tundra plain, a wooden sign juts out of the ground alongside a faint path. A crust of ice and snow hides the sign's markings. /A book filled with illustrations of a wealthy family lays by the road side. /A bugbear and his bride ride by in a royal carriage. /A roadblock and checkpoint have been set up by local church militants. /When at the bottom of a steep sloping road, there is a rumble and a large boulder comes rushing toward the PCs. When the rock finally stops, the group spots old bloodstains and a kill-score carved into the side. /A deranged, barefoot man on the verge of starvation and wearing rags sits by the side of the road. He rocks back and forth muttering, "The hills have eyes...the hills have eyes...the eyes of the hills are alive inside."

The PCs are threatened by the dragon for a toll for using the dragon's road. /A strange old man offers the PCs a book in a language they cannot read. /In error, a company of knights on a quest hunts down the PCs for a terrible crime. When the knights realize their mistake, they insist the PCs join their noble quest to capture the evil criminals. /A woman on the road is actually a shape-changed harpy. /A shrine to a god of travel stands by the roadside. The shrine looks ancient but has been recently cleaned by someone. /Gnomes hold a yard sale. /A man in shabby clothes and bearing a pole with an unusual flaming taper affixed to its top passes you on the cobble walkway, lighting the street lamps for the evening. /Small wain, with a farmer and a donkey with dislocated knee. /A crippled goblin asks for help after being trampled in a hit-and-run. /Beside the road lie the remains of an old rotten catapult. Strangely, it seems as if someone is attempting to repair it, though whoever it is doesn't appear to be about at the moment. /The road quickly becomes narrow and overgrown with thorny plants that are poisonous. /Brigands ambush the party. After the fight, a search of the bodies uncovers a treasure map. /The den of goblinoids is shunned by most travelers, but a truce surrounds it as humans can't destroy it, nor can the goblins destroy the human settlement. Trading and socializing are possible, though dangerous. The PCs stumble into one of these negotiations as it turns hostile. If the PCs throw in with the humans, the goblins will run away. Then the human settlement blames the PCs for bringing the might of the goblins down on the area. /A young woman in simple clothes cries beside the road.

Hidden threat: infiltrator and sabotage in the PCs' traveling group. /A carriage is pulled over and the driver is looking for help - his passenger is giving birth. /In dense wilderness where only the road is passable, the group finds the trail covered in increasingly thick slime. The PCs eventually find themselves stuck behind an enormous and slow-moving snail. /A dog or other animal tries to make you follow it. /It is dark and a commoner stands next to a wagon with a torch, yelling a woman's name and begging her to come back. After a fight over something stupid, like when to camp for the night, she stomped off into the dark woods. The twist: his wife is a visibly obvious monster (like a giantess or centaur). /A carriage is stuck high up in a tree. /You're halfway across an icy bridge when motion below catches your eye. Through the nearly transparent arch, you spy an orca chasing a seal in the frigid water below. /A military force has taken control of a section of the road for reasons of national security. They refuse to let the PCs pass. /While resting at a small pond off the road, a flock of white geese land in the water. Soon afterward a lone goose lands nearby.

And now it's hungry. Do the PCs look like a threat or easy food? /A traveling paladin swears undying love to one of the PCs. /An executioner and victim walk towards the block. Guards and clergy watch with grim faces. /The group comes across a three-way traffic jam at a fork in the road, and three arguing wagon masters refusing to give way. /A leprechaun blocks the road. /In the morning while breaking camp, the PCs spot a bush that wasn't there before. /A beautiful woman, adorned in the robes of an enchantress, emerges from hiding near the road and implores you to lend her aid. /A rude toll collector (legitimate) demands payment for the King's Road. /A fearsome troll hangs suspended from a hunter's snare, the rope is slowly unravelling. /An odd-looking elderly man appears just out of bow range.

He tries to sell his wares to the party. /The road crosses a region of arid desert. Yet, on the hazy sandblasted horizon you see a solitary green tree. You rub your eyes for fear of mirage, but mirage or not, you still see the tree as green as ever. /The PCs wake up to find their campsite has been ransacked. None of their normal gear is missing but their items are strewn everywhere (perhaps an important quest item is missing).

When you are halfway across, the rope at both ends of the bridge bursts into flame. /Guards approach and ask what business you have at the bridge they guard. /A bend on the coastal road made smooth and slippery by the sea water splashing and spraying over it, brings risk of falling into the sea. /A spooked horse guards a corpse. /A tree of local renown, the Old King, stands atop a nearby knoll.

It is not going well. /The PCs find a dead body on the side of the road. Trapped inside the corpse is a demon looking for a new host. And the PCs are looking pretty good.... /A tree burns brightly. Curiously, the fire is not spreading and the tree is not being consumed. /For as far as you can see, the road has been pounded into a nearly impassable, mucky mess. You may navigate it at much reduced speed, or risk an adjacent murk of a wood for a chance at quicker passage. /You become aware a bandit demanding a toll is actually alone and has set up a crossbow to fire when he triggers a badly hidden tripwire.

If the PCs buy it, the man runs away laughing madly, shouting "I'm free! Free at last! You poor fools!" /High crops on your left and right rustle slightly as you approach. /An old witch collects herbs from the bushes along the roadside while her cat educates passersby about the dangers of herbal medicines. /The group meet an uncannily similar party of adventurers going the opposite way. /The party finds an abandoned cart and pony, in good condition and with some supplies, near a clear trail that leads to a cave. A small construct guards the cave, and inside the cave are the remains of a wizard, scholar or priest, along with the bodies of two men at arms and several small creatures. /A forest fire moves fast towards the party. /A noble's carriage and entourage appear in front of you. The coachman says, "Out of the way peasants!" /Part of the road turns to quicksand and pitches the party to the bottom of a dungeon before sealing up over top of them. The mad laughter of their most hated enemy echoes magically in their ears. /An archway spans the road. Muddle paths bypass it on either side. Passing under the arch results in a terrible lightning bolt shock. If the victim survives, they will receive a divine vision. A clue or hook, perhaps. /A single piper parades by, followed by a multitude of children. /A roadside shrine houses an evil spirit that attacks travellers. /A wandering zombie stays at the center of the road and attacks mindlessly. An easy kill, if it were not for the horde of undead roaming the nearby corn field. /Near a bend in the road, the group spots two creatures fighting over a tattered cloth. After killing or scattering the creatures, the PCs realize they've stumbled onto three shallow, unmarked, hastily dug graves. Left with only their undergarments, the ravaged corpses leave few clues as to their origin. /A roadside stand offered fresh vegetables and fruit to passers by. /Noxious gas rises from a bog ahead, swallowing up the road. /A gaunt traveler approaches and begs for bread and water. /An ogre strides from the wilderness, offering his services as guide and bodyguard on a dangerous stretch of road. If paid, he serves admirably and departs. If attacked, he signals others of his band hidden nearby and they swarm to attack. /A seemingly friendly travelling menagerie shares the road with the party, but some of their more dangerous animals get loose. /The party finds a lake of molten lava. /On a forgotten mountain path below a run-down keep, a squad of elderly soldiers in tattered armour challenges the group. They still loyally hold their position for a war that ended decades ago. /Wind knocks a beehive out of an overhanging tree. /Smoke starts billowing up from just over the next hill. /The new slate road is surprisingly smooth and limits traction. /An enchanted fountain suddenly appears beside the road. /A row of hooded stone statues guard the sides of the road ahead. /A robed figure on a runaway contraption, yelling for help. /The brush on one side of the road breaks open as a great antlered buck leaps forth, clearing the path without ever treading upon it, and disappears on the other side. Close after, a hunter appears in pursuit, breathless and arrow nocked. /The PCs encounter the corpse of a rare monster. /The lone stone bridge across the chasm has long since collapsed. There is a rope bridge close-by in its place, though it too has seen better days. Going around the chasm will take a couple days more. /At least three days from anywhere, your party finds a huddle of colorful tents and wagons, with gypsies about them, observing your approach in an appraising fashion. /A single dragon's wing hangs from a tree beside the road. /Two dozen townsfolk with torches and pitchforks head off into the woods, shouting about a monster. /The road ahead narrows as the surrounding landscape turns into marsh. /Dawn broke only a half hour ago, but suddenly night has overtaken you again. /You come across a horse up a tree. /At a flooded river crossing, the humming of insects becomes deafening. /A vampire hunter seeks to temporarily join the team, warning of the dangers of his prey.

Two nearby giants ask the group if they'd mind stopping for a while and being a part of their chess game, as they're missing some pieces. /Rock slide reveals cave entrance. /Large, strong arms wrap around a tree beside you and rip it from the ground, roots and all. /At first the bard you met along the road was quite entertaining, but by now you've heard his entire repertoire a number of times. Why won't he take the hint and be on his way? /A collie stands in the middle of the road, it awaits the PCs and then tries to lead them somewhere. The dog leads them to an abandoned well in the woods. Ideas for the well: It leads to a dungeon with the collie's lost master trapped inside. Or "Timmy" is a troll using the dog to lead prey to his well. /Golden eyes follow the party in the distance and a howl is let loose as either a warning or a beckoning. /2d4 gnomes riding rabbits. /A swarm of giant locusts descends. They get into armor, nip flesh, sting and don't die. They eat anything the party was hoping to gather for food, they will eat the party's food. It will cost days to go around them. /A wagon bogged in the mud, with a cursing merchant and harried teamsters. /Localized radiation. /A farmer with lands adjacent to the road has a problem - a cow has fallen in a muddy stream and can't get up. /The muted roar of falling water in the distance hints of a waterfall up ahead. /At the head of the valley, a dam bursts, giving the party only moments to find safety before the flood waters arrive. /A tinker provides all sorts of lurid rumours about the locale, then requests payment for his assistance. /A campsite with several recently used fire pits is by the side of the road. Hastily abandoned? Sign of battle? Strange footprints? /Four days of rain and even your oiled tarps are starting to fail. This must be a supernatural or magical storm? Are you getting closer to the source to father away from the trouble? /A pack of hunting hounds races across the your path on the trail of...something. The sound of shouting indicates their master is not far behind. /Two abandoned wagons one pristine the other in ruin. /Four knights canter by on light horses, trailed by their squires leading the heavy horses and pack animals. /Ruins of an airship crashed on the road impede travelers. /Ambush: cavalry behind the PCs, keeping their distance. Hidden threat, infantry ahead. /Something forgotten. At camp, a member of your party has rummaged through his packs numerous times in a mounting panic, but the last time he saw the mystic one-of-a-kind heirloom, you were at an inn three days back. /Flies buzz around the party as the heat of the day becomes unbearable. /The party is chased from the road by local tribals, herded towards a large nearby cave with a prominent, protruding entrance, sporting two large stalagmites, a damp, spongy floor, and a rather foul, steamy atmosphere. /The ferry needed to cross the river is available, but the ferryman is hopelessly drunk. /On an icy slope, someone has poured water down the trail turning it into a nearfrictionless slide into a gulch or chasm or pit or cavern. /A tree filled with dancing fairies catches your eyes. Strange really, there are no holidays this time of year. /A corpse whose head has been swapped with that of some mysterious creature lies on the road. /Four drunken sailors stagger down the road, singing bawdy songs and holding on to wenches.

Just out of town the grateful locals jump out and surprise them with an unexpected picnic celebration. /The tavern where the PCs plan to spend the night is currently on fire. /A new sign pointing down a narrow path off the road saying, "Fresh Berries - Pick Your Own." /As your party rests, a harmless forest animal approaches from the woodline. /A platoon of soldiers march past and their officer orders the party to fall in: they've just been conscripted. /Minor royalty rides by on a sedan chair. Then one of its bearers trips on a rock. The noble screams, "Careful, idiots! I nearly dropped my meal." You notice a sealed parchment left behind on the ground. /Someone wants to steal from the party to give to the poor. /As the bandits begin their assault, the party hears a shriek as the caravan's pregnant passenger goes into labor. /Mid-storm, the party reaches a rushing, swollen river only to find the bridge has been washed away. A bedraggled figure stands in the shelter of the wreckage. He gestures at the PCs with urgency. /As the PC travel down a road, they pass a military camp. Morale in the camp is high, and the men are boisterous and relaxed. The PCs are treated in a friendly though detached manner as they pass. /A wayfarer's tavern with the windows and doors boarded up from the inside and horrible claw-marks on the outside. /The party find a trail of gold coins leading off the path. /A band of ragged urchins make half-hearted attempts to pickpocket travellers. /A burned cart rests in the center of the road. On the body of the driver (or rider) is an urgent message for one of the PCs. /Thunderous noise shakes the mountain path. Giants? Dragons? Blasting? /A dozen or so boys play in a clearing next to the road. /The group passes an old farmer and his nag heading toward the same town the PCs are heading toward. He gives them a wave and a gap-toothed smile. A little while later they pass him again. And then again.... /Constant rain from recent days have turned the road into a muddy quagmire.

Nothing but wilderness lies beyond. /A band of grim-faced knights halt the party at a crossroads while they bury the still-gnashing head of a necromancer. /An ornate carriage has shattered its wheel and sits by the roadway. Tracks indicate whoever was in the carriage wandered into the wilderness. /Many arrowheads pierce the ground, their shafts sticking out at many angles. Closer inspection reveals them to be no common hunting arrow. /A gentle stream beside this road is home to a giant crocodile that lies in wait for unwary travelers. /A small dire wolf cub drags small sticks across the road, playing in the dust as its mother watches from the forest. /A scorned woman chases her cheating husband, throwing rocks at him when convenient. /A tinker or tanner needs help to unblock his cart. /Just ahead, a huge tree trunk flies across the road and crashes down on the other side.

You hear movement in the bushes nearby. /A fallen tree lies across the road ahead. Closer inspection reveals it to be an injured treant. /A nondescript traveller asks to travel with the group for safety. On the trip he asks to hear the group's exploits. The traveller is actually a famous writer or bard, and the group gets a widely-acclaimed book or song written about their adventures (or their tales of adventure stolen!). /A questionable-looking troupe of entertainers argue with each other. /A dark shadow blots out the moon and then it's gone. /The road becomes a crumbling spiral staircase that scales a cliff. /A small group of men take target practice with crossbows. They express great interest in you, and one invites you to put an apple on your head in exchange for a "special something." /A surly man with a crossbow sits at the mouth of a covered bridge, the only river crossing for miles. He offers to guide the group safely through the short, straight, empty tunnel of the bridge for a fee. /A ruined water bottle lies at the edge of the dirt. /Spirits lift at the sight of a rainbow that seems to start from a particularly beautiful part of forest only a few miles off. /The road turns to cobblestones. /You travel at night under a new moon. Your party's scout points up at the sky, where traditionally stationary constellations swirl about as if stirred by a cosmic spoon. /A small group of men take target practice with crossbows. They turn their bows on you immediately as you approach. /As the PCs travel by a ruin near the road, their food and water is spoiled and ruined. /A small group of men take target practice with crossbows. They express great interest in you and challenge you for a small wager. One of them boasts, "Jarvis here is the best crossbowman in the kingdom." /Perfectly positioned in the middle of the road lies a dead body. /The party runs over a shepherd's goat.

Guards then stop and take interest. /A trail of bread crumbs on the road leads into a dense part of the forest. /Fog across the road hides a sudden drop into a chasm. /A crazy backwoods seditionist has made up his own country, with its own legal system and economy only he uses. He's a fairly powerful hedge wizard, and demands the PCs obey his laws. /A group of travelers has stopped to rest their mounts by the roadside, and are having a drink and a quick dice game. Perhaps a merchant in the crowd is looking for an escort and will hire the party. The dice game is chance for a gambler in the party to earn a few coins. Maybe the whole thing is a scam run by brigands. /The tavern where the PCs plan to spend the night is closed because the staff have been slaughtered by monsters that still lurk nearby. /Bricks and motor debris litter the roadway as you near the clearing of ruined home. /A roiling bank of fog moves fast towards you.

The morale there is kept high by a preacher. It is unknown what motives the preacher has. /Several knights practice jousting. /A weird burst of power causes certain mutations. /A massive stone with strange runes. /The PCs come across pit traps, tripwires and arrow traps. They traps are from bandits that have moved on to a new ambush point. The idea is to put the PCs on edge and expecting an ambush that never comes. /After sleeping on the roadside, the party wakes to find their entire camp surrounded by dew-spangled spider webs, yet they are unharmed. /A traveler warns you to turn back as a dragon has been terrorizing the local populace.

They will take any measures necessary to prevent the PCs from giving away their position. /The sun sets in a purple sky, and a passing traveler says it is an omen of _____. /A traveler with the PCs slowly becomes undead. /The party passes through a sudden fog that smells sweetly of rosewater. Not long after, voices, animal growls and loud crashes emanate from the mist from all directions. /A man on an ostrich hurtles by, yelling to the PCs to give way. /A small bright green snake falls from an overhanging branch into a PC's shirt. /A posse chasing a killer ride towards the PCs. Do they mistake the characters for their quarry? /Humanoid statue (flesh to stone). /It begins raining cats and dogs. Literally. /Every sign on the road has been defaced with the mark of a local brigand. /A hailstorm drops (1-2 small, 3-4 medium, 5-6 large) sized hailstones. /A dragon, wyvern or dinosaur gives lays an egg in the path ahead. The party may easily go around without trouble, as the mother is too involved. /A woodsman asks for directions to an old woman's cottage so he can attack a werewolf. /A box of hand tools lies scattered in the weeds at the edge of the road.

Some are retreating traders and their guards taking the front, whilst the others are bandits moving to flank the group. /Blood red-orange flowers dot the ground as far as the eye can see.

Soon the mud is two feet deep. Water in the ditches alongside starts to bubble. /A stretch of the road proves to be exceptionally well maintained. But why? And by whom? Still, it means the journey advances well. /Early in the morning hours, a herd of deer cross the road ahead of the party. In the middle of the herd is a large white dire stag. If undisturbed, the herd will pass peacefully. /A potions cart has broken its axle and has spilled its cargo into the road.

So dense are these heads crowded together that should the party attempt to pass through, the heads assault their ankles and feet with bites. /A large flying shadow passes overhead, spooking the horses. /A fence crosses the mountain trail. No other structures are in sight. Tracks along the far side of the fence line are no more than two days old and appear to be mostly ovine. /While on the road the PCs come across a traveling merchant. The merchant offers a free sample of his tincture, which he claims does everything from curing warts to making you stronger and smarter. /A dog trails the PCs, staying in the distance but always there in the morning. /A great green djinn sits dejectedly upon a rock alongside the road.

Are they really magic potions? Or just colored water and a phony magic aura? /A violent earthquake creates a deep rift across the road. /A horse neighs as you find a coaching inn. It's getting dark and clouds roll in while warm light glows under the door. A pleasant smell of boiling stew fills the air. /Your party either passes a band of pilgrims headed quietly for sacred terrain. /On a wooded trail, just around a turn in the road, a rope has been strung between two trees high enough to catch a mounted rider.

It is wearing the signet ring and other identifying equipment of a nearby ruler's only child the party knew and liked. /As you walk along the sidewalk, a small child runs onto the road in front of the oncoming traffic. His terrified expression says he is not going to stop. /Smoke rises in the distance. It might be a raid, slash and burn agriculturists, a forest fire or an army encampment. /An aggressive bear attacks the party's mounts. /An old shrine at a side of the road, with some food offerings. /A solitary monster has made camp near the road and sleeps peacefully as the PCs pass. /An addressed package fallen off a cart lies on the road. /The blizzard blinds the party and covers the road sign that marks the correct direction. /A weapon master battles 10 brigands to a standstill as they try to steal his wagon armory. Sooner or later he will tire. /A figure kneels in the grass on the side of the road, oblivious to the group's approach. They have lenses in frames over their eyes and seem to be making notes and sketches about insect life. /A village guard patrolling the road asks for the PCs' license to bear weapons. /A line of guards blocks off the road. One of them directs traffic onto a small side road that seems to lead to nowhere. /An injured wild dog howls on the side of the road. /Recently assaulted merchant's caravan with just one survivor. /He's Flimme, I'm Flamme, and have we got a deal for you! /A travelling peddler sells curses. /A bridge crosses a river of fog - no not fog - a river of spirits or ghosts. /The PCs are caught by an earthquake, and a newborn chasm blocks their path. /A howling wind blows up from nowhere sending anything not tied down tumbling into the distance. /The road passes through a blasted heath. /Deep in the wilderness, the road leads to an ice bridge crossing a gully. As you test the arch for soundness, several wolves emerge from beneath it to menace you. /A baby dragon cries loudly as it staggers about in the centre of the road. /An annoying writer shows up and tries to sell the party his book. He proclaims it is the most awesome best thing since the invention of wine. /Pilgrims who have just been denied entry to the holy of holies due to lack of proper sacrifice find the party suitable candidates. /A fallen-tree bridge over a stream turns out, while the group is halfway across, to be a mired treant. /A gorge or enormous sinkhole has opened in the road, creating a deep or bottomless pit which will take some time to circumnavigate. /The ferry needed to cross the river is damaged, and the ferryman needs help and materials to repair it. /A cursed warrior guards the bridge ahead. He lets the party cross if they can break his curse or provide information pertaining to his possible cure. /The party spots a gaunt and disheveled zombie werewolf eating its prey. /A leprechaun offers a PC his last dying wish before passing from this mortal coil. /The angry, maniacal giant appears to love fire - and hate horses. /Ambush: robbery in progress.

Do the PCs notice? /An impossibly tall ladder rests against the branch of a tree, its top vanishing into the low clouds. /A fallen tree lies across the road blocking the road. A dryad sobs in the branches. /A bull, larger than any you have ever seen, snorts and rampages about the road destructively. /A sign says, "Kittens: Free to Good Home" with a box beneath. There is one kitten left. /They're not flowers: they're butterflies! /Markings of a dangerous tribe line the road. /Three milk cows have gotten into loco weed and it's time for their milking. /Stray dogs attack a sheep. /The muffled cries of a kitten draw your attention to the side of the road. A burlap sack with something wiggling inside it lies in the brush. (Upon opening the bag flip a coin. Heads: it's a normal kitten - a bit hungry but otherwise unharmed. Tails: it's a dead cat. The cat died of hunger several days ago. If the PCs just close the bag after finding the dead cat, it will start wiggling and crying again. Any time the bag is opened, flip a coin again. The bag will always have either a dead or alive cat inside it, until you take the cat out, in which case, it's just a burlap sack.) /The PC in front falls into a deep pit, then a bunch of savages attack from all sides. /A disreputable merchant has set up a road stall that sells pies. Unfortunately, the pies are made with rotten meat, and whilst the pies taste fine, all who eat them become violently ill. /A farmer struggles with a broken wheel on his laden wagon full of potatoes. His young son throws baby potatoes at you. /A huge winged shadow flies over your party, following the direction of the road. /The sky darkens as the trees grow together over the path. /Some sort of carnival blocks the road. The carnival seems festive, but the details are all wrong. As the party draws near, a threatening demon manifests before them and politely suggests a substantial detour as the demon ritual simply cannot be disturbed. /Among the normal trees lining the roadway are several that resemble humanoids twisted in agony. /The source unseen, a rhythmic knocking can be heard far off the side of the road. /A burnt-out toll-station, with the murdered bodies of the toll inspectors still scattered around. /The party spots several dragons, griffons and rocs flying over the adjacent mountain range. One of the dragons veers towards the party and commences a slow and purposeful descent. /A crow lands on a PC's shoulder, grabs a shiny ornament from her hair and flies away. /Rains have turned a segment of the road into mud. Pack animals and steeds can wade in it, but wagons may well get stuck. /A wounded dragon lies across the road. /A group of people stand around a burned corpse nervously looking at each other, then in the PCs' direction. Some try to quickly leave the scene while the more brave and curious continue to wait for the PCs' approach. /Caltrops scattered liberally across the path. A sign reads, "Beware! Trap!" /A man sits on a wall along the road. /Barbed wire lies in an entangled mess across the road. /The road forks around a monolith, statue or war memorial. The stone has been recently daubed with occult symbols in fresh blood. /The ground rumbles as the PCs move through a mountain pass. It's an earthquake! The characters can escape with minor injuries from bouncing rocks, but just around the bend, a massive sinkhole has swallowed the entire path. /Someone does not want guests. Three skulls impaled upon sticks block a side trail that branches off the road. /Two horses gallop by your party, dragging a flailing driverless wagon behind. /In a mountain pass, someone has built a high wall across the path the party was following, forcing them instead into the mouth of a nearby cave. /An enraged boar bursts out of the forest and charges straight at you. Minutes later, an angry nobleman appears and demands why you have interfered with his hunt. /A pleasant voice seems to chant on the breeze. /Ahead is a field of fragrant and vibrant flowers, fruit trees or berried bushes. Unbeknownst to the party, the flora is poisonous. /A soft groan from the canopy alerts a PC to bloodied figure held to high branches by silver nails. /A truly massive mimic has installed itself as the bridge on a lesser-used ford. The disappearance of travelers on this trail has led to this path gaining a sinister reputation. /A depressed bard asks sing-song, rhetorical questions of the PCs. /A sloping segment of the road sparkles beautifully with black ice that formed during the night. /The PCs come to an unmarked and unfamiliar crossroads. Which is the right way to go? Where do the other three paths lead? /You approach a rickety, swaying bridge. /An old woman at a crossroads offers to give a PC anything he wants for a lock of their hair. /The road is blocked by a village with plague markers outside it. /A group of small well-dressed children approach. At first glance, none seem older than 10. /The PCs encounter a cattle stampede. The stampede is nearby but no threat. The PCs are blamed for causing the stampede by the chasing cowboys. /The road closed due to slime migration. /The usually empty road is crowded with traffic. /A young runner, a messenger bag slapping against his back, sprints past the party. /A brightly colored fair with many wagons, minstrels, jugglers and acrobats.

Their commander tries to "recruit" the party into her fighting force. /The road before you becomes paved with smooth, shiny cobblestones. A tremor runs the length of the road and too late you realize what you mistook for cobblestones are actually the scales of a giant serpent. /As the PCs enjoy their lunch on the roadside, they hear ticking from the nearby bush. Sitting on a rock behind a bush is a clock that reads the correct time. However, at the twelve-o-clock position, at midnight, the words "The End of the World" are engraved into the face. /The sweltering heat upon this lightly forested road has slowed your progress down to a crawl. A cool breeze from an adjacent wood draws your puzzled gaze to the snow-covered trees and ground therein. /A squad of soldiers have set up to search people on the roadside. Their sergeant beckons the party to approach. /At a lake alongside the road, a group of barbarians holds a solemn Viking-like funeral, burning the ferry with the corpse on it. /A strange door stands upright in the middle of the road. /A gypsy fortune teller offers to read one party member's palm, and oddly, she says she'll do so for no charge whatsoever. /Two people are arguing over the possession of a pig in a canvas bag. /A mass of small birds swoop from the sky and begin murderously pecking and slashing your faces. /The field is filled with enormous and mishappen plants that smell faintly of rotting flesh. /A druid and her animal companion takes their rest by the side of the road. /A young woman with a crying baby wrapped in a shawl is hotly pursued by a band of rough-looking men. /A young woman stands on the bridge, crying about something that fell in the water. /A weapon sharpener approaches the party. /The PCs come upon a sobbing woman holding a teenage boy who looks to have been severely beaten.

The content is covered by thick grey cloth but you hear the sound of jiggling glass. /You come across the remains of a battle. Several dead men lay pierced by arrows. Each wears the same uniform bearing arms of a well-liked baron, their ornate scabbards and quivers empty. /A scruffy kid has set up an apple juice stall on an old wooden crate. The cloudy juice is from old fallen apples and doesn't taste that good. /A tree has fallen on a wagon carrying an alchemist and his laboratory. /Horns blow in the distance. /A bear cub has caught its foot under a root beside the road.

The road section is now so narrow only one wagon can pass at a time, but neither wagon driver is prepared to back down. The situation is made worse by all the other travelers now stuck behind both wagons. With so many differing opinions and everyone becoming impatient, tempers grow shorter by the minute. /Kobolds attack a merchant's wagon. Two kobolds attack the door with hatchets. The door blows open and a kobold is thrown out of the wagon. A dwarf appears in the doorway, brandishing a hammer. The dwarven merchant has purchased some of the kobold tribes' eggs, which were stolen from their lair yesterday by an opportunistic rogue. The kobolds have tracked the eggs to the wagon, killing the rogue en route a few miles away. /Partway through a tunnel, a strange glowing fungus infests the walls and ceiling. As you pass beneath it, something drips down and acid starts to eat away at your skin. /An ancient wolf, forced out of his old pack by a new alpha male, hunts travellers on the roadway. /The waist-high grass hides two dozen dog houses. /A forest fire burns on the side of the road. /The wilderness is controlled by a dragon. It has a nest not far from the road.

Unfortunately, the innkeeper knows this and charges high prices. /On a large road, a ship on wheels manned by eccentric road-pirates assaults the party. /The sky turns green. Then the wind dies down and funnel clouds appear. /Two ranks of royal guard form between you and an oncoming procession, allowing the large entourage and perhaps the king himself - difficult to say with all the covered carriages - to pass by. /Volcanic activity sends rivers of lava across the road, threatening to cut the group off in a sea of fire. /A group of much less powerful adventurers meet the party on the road, returning defeated from a nearby dungeon. They offer to give the party information on what they saw there in exchange for a share of the treasure. /The wind holds a scrap of paper against a tree. The paper turns out to be a wanted poster offering a hefty sum for one of the PCs. The party has never been near the town offering the reward. /In the distance, pillars of flame, smoke and feathers periodically erupt. As you draw closer, a lone wizard makes mystical passes in the direction of another tree. /A miniature tarrasque naps in a sunny spot on the trail. /The road has potholes in it, wreaking havoc on steed and pack animal legs and wagon wheels. /A hawk soars overhead. You hear the bells in its jesses. It circles the same spot without tire. /Unusually cold though clear weather causes hardship on pack animals, travelers, steeds, wagons. /A pile of stone rubble at the side of the road holds no significance, except as a marker for the sleeping place of a large mimic masquerading as part of the road. /A lone, decrepit milestone marks the distance to a city you've never heard of. /The road you are on is now a ravenous, snake-like creature. It twists and writhes beneath your feet. Its eyes pop open, and the face turns towards you. /A ranger trains his bear on the side of the road. /A band of twenty storm giants are incredibly stupid and bad at math. When they capture travelers they can be "paid off" for one copper coin each. /On the road ahead is an accident scene, with injured people and ruined vehicles. /A huge earth elemental eats the road ahead. /A large battle axe sticks from a tree. Is it indicating a direction to take? /A pair of farmers have a discussion about crop rotation. /A fifty-way intersection marked with bad directions to odd locations lies before the PCs. /A pit trap on the road's verge has caught a vociferous pet dog. /Localized unseasonable weather confronts the party (for example, snow in the summer). /Cold rain that freezes on touch makes progress hazardous. /A visitor stops to ask for directions to an interesting place. /A strange object lies in the middle of the road. /It's early dawn. Out of a thick fog a tall figure emerges. /From around the corner a harried man runs towards the party. Chasing him is an angry woman brandishing an ornate wooden rolling pin. /A druid has planted trees on the road, "taking it back" for nature. /The smell of swine fills your nostrils as you make your way down the valley slope. What wonders will you see when you round the bend? /While the PCs encamp, a huge swath of ants approaches and begins to take the PCs' provisions. /A beat up, screaming princess flees a fire rhino ridden by a knight in molten armor. /Weird Joe, a halfling who owns a floating inn, attempts to sell the PCs fire wine, which is literally 99% alcohol on fire. /A farmer pushes a cart of hay towards town. /A heavily wounded soldier. /Flowing magma is not a threat at this distance. Still, the pungent scent in the air can only worsen if you continue on this path. /A small pouch showing a crest or emblem lies near the road. It contains lead figurines of exquisite detail and in realistic poses. /Two small children stand all alone beside the road. They are dirty and the youngest one cries easily. They wait for their parents to return. They do not know why their parents left. /Poles with impaled rotting heads line the sides of the road. /The bridge over the ravine seems to be out. Nearby a huge fallen tree stretches across the expanse, promising a precarious crossing. /Deep in the wilds, both sides of the road become crowded with floating mirrors. /In a night passage through the woods, your party's scout stops everyone, motioning for silence. As everyone becomes still, whispers come from among the trees on either side, the words indistinct. /An elf of questionable morality offers free potions to all who pass through the elf woods. /Several beautiful drunk women stumble out of the bush and mistake the PCs for wealthy merchants. /An elderly woman wanders the verge of the road, bent double and carrying a basket of foraged produce. She asks the party for a ride on their wagon to ease her tired feet. /A old man wanders up and down a stretch of road, unable to remember where he was going. /A traveling sheriff stops the party and issues a citation for some minor infraction. /Beggar asks for help. /An immense dire wolf blocks the party's passage. Your hired guide raises a quavering finger and points, uttering the local legend's name: "Frostbite!" He then turns on his heel and runs back towards the village where you hired him. /You are crossing a bridge when, suddenly, from behind one of the bridge's pillars, a man steps out and demands you pay a toll to cross. You ask by what authority does he collect the toll and the man produces a dubious looking bit of vellum with what appears to be the King's seal stamped upon it. /Hidden behind some bushes is a shrine dedicated to an unknown deity. It looks ominous. /A mud slide threatens to sweep the party into a swollen river. /A group of bandits arguing and blaming each other over the chest of something useless they just stole (feather dusters, mouse-traps, fishing weights). /Screams of pain come from a covered wagon on the road's shoulder. /Eying you warily, another party of adventurers allows you wide berth as they try to make their way around you. /Intoxicating flowers line the road on either side. /A spy joins the PCs, aspiring to use them as cover to get to the PCs' destination. /An unruly child has gone missing from a cart.

She predicts the party member will find a beautiful person in the next city and it will be the love of his life. She provides no further details. Later on, a beautiful person flirts with the character. /A pair of children approach, their eyes wandering and faces anxious. They seem lost. /Jumping cobblestones. /Along a forgotten and plant-strewn trail lies a conspicuously clean shrine to an ancient pagan deity. /Acid hits the party. /A will-o-wisp floats eerily across the center of the road. /A wagon is stuck in the mud. Anyone who helps learns the wagon carries bricks of gold for a secret mission to ransom a prince. The wagon driver gives several bricks to the party for their help in the mission. /Four goblins clad in loin cloths burst out of the bushes and accost the party with piteous cries. They beg the party to rescue them from pursuing slavers. Seconds later the party hears creatures fast approaching. /As though from the blue, a large volley of arrows falls down among the party as they travel along the road, but the attack is not repeated. /See it? says the scout. "You must stand just so." Assuming the position, you can see what the scout sees - an odd portal showing through to some blasted landscape, floating in the air alongside the road, visible only from this one place. /A large area of the road in front of you is covered with a thin layer of ashes and soot. You hear crackling from above and look up just in time to see a fireball come down towards you. /A lightning bolt strikes the ground in front of you. /A wizened gray mage stands beside the road. With taunts and abuse, he dares any approaching spell caster to outperform him. /The group is followed from the last town by a band of children who want to go on adventures with them. /Strange tracks lead off the road. /A bloodied old man cries for help. /A drunken sailor stands on a bridge, issuing challenges. /The troll demands a ridiculous sum to cross his bridge...or take his place as guardian! /A treetop house hidden near the road seems like a good place to make an ambush. /A woman stops and prophesies that one of the characters is going to die. /A druid preaches to passersby on the road into the city, telling of the evils of civilization, and how the city encroaches upon the woods and nature. /Pieces of a splintered wagon litter the path. /A small group of drunken men take target practice with crossbows, shooting at apples on each other's heads. Your hear one say, "I'll tell 'ma if you don't let me shoot the crossbow too" /It is said many gods walk the land as mortals. Could the beautiful being bathing in the stream be one? /You find a small leather bag. It smells of moisture, and contains a set of keys and a vellum map to the location of a small keep. /A meteorite crashes to earth in the middle of the road. /A traveling cleric requests the party donate half its coins to an orphanage in the next town down the road. /The road is littered with mines or bear traps. /A toll bridge where the garrison doesn't only collect tolls but also searches all travelers - looking for drugs, illegal weapons, stolen goods, or whatever the PCs may (or may not) carry. /Up ahead a wyvern lands. A man in armor and tabard dismounts and faces you. /The road is in terrible condition after sabotage or bombardment. /A whole tribe of 80 goblins marches toward a village. /An old man in outdated-looking armor approaches the party on horseback. He accuses a PC of being a half-orc and challenges them to a fight. Closer inspection reveals some of his kit to be fake - his helm is just a bowl. /Travelling through this haunted country at night lands you in the bony clutches of a barrow wight and his retinue. /A large herd of cattle cross the road in front of you. As they cross, they become spooked, for reasons unknown, and begin to stampede. /The PCs encounter a large flock of sheep and its shepherd. The shepherd is a rogue looking to pick up a few extra coppers (silvers or gold too!) from the PCs as they are distracted by the sheep. /An earthquake shakes the area and tears a rift in the roadway. The rift might be a small crack or as drastic as a 20 foot shift (1906 San Fran earthquake, for example). This event should have impacts further down the road (on settlements, other travelers, other encounters). /In an area of volcanic springs, clouds of venting steam and jets of boiling sulfurous water burst from the ground. /The way ahead is suddenly a lot less picturesque as a hail of arrows flies towards your group from nearby rocky outcroppings. /A slave caravan passes by. The slaves are bugbears. /Five cowled monks on a pilgrimage kneel in the middle of the road, praying softly. /A pack of wolves spooks the PCs' animals but is smart enough not to get close. They just stay near enough so the pack animals are almost unmanageable. /Several chariots blow by chasing a large wild boar. Men scream, "In the name of the Prince!" /Uneasily, you pass a moonlit graveyard far out in the countryside. You travel in silence until a plaintive child's wail pierces the night, coming from among the gloomy tombstones. /A thief in a hanging cage at an intersection begs for a crust of bread. Children throw baby potatoes at him. /The road breaks out of the dense forest into a clearing. You see a large coach house with outbuildings. Smoke rises from the chimney and you hear hearty drinking songs within. /In a slight depression in the road, the party hears a sudden rushing noise, and looks up to see a seven foot high flash flood bearing down upon them. /Strange balls of light surround you, causing momentary confusion. /A mob of villagers flee the brigands who burnt down their homes. /A militia practices their ranging with a local catapult. For fun, a few decide to launch themselves into the lake beside the road.

Upon investigation, the source of the sound appears to be a baby owlbear. /The bridge behind you collapses. There's no way back to safety. /A toddler crawls in the middle of an otherwise empty road. /A man-sized bolt lays broken on the stone cobbled road. /You can't remember hearing the wind bellow like a huge beast before, and the yells of your party are quite lost upon it. Then a massive funnel cloud touches down not one hundred yards before you. Behind it, you spy two more. /You hear music coming from a small box with numbers on it from the side of the road. /The canyon is steep, craggy and loud. The crash of angry rapids echo below. There are no visible routes to the bottom. /A thick fog has settled on the bridge ahead. /A group of peasants are met travelling to the market in the next town. They offer cheap produce. /The road is lined with criminals chained to stocks, with only hands and heads poking through. A visible punishment for wrongdoers.

However, a carefull search reveals an intact and hidden compartment. /A memorial avenue of trees commemorates a long-forgotten war. /The road is blocked by a large but makeshift fortification, manned by a band of kobolds, goblins or ratmen. /What seems like a typical thunderstorm sweeps over the area. However, as the storm reaches its peak with heavy rains and winds, strange things start to happen. PCs hit with the rain suffer temporary polymorph effects, and trees struck by lightning become sentient or turn into other objects or living things. /A smouldering unattended campfire starts to burn the roots of a nearby tree. /A skeleton lies at one side of the path. It shakes its head as if to say "don't go this way" when someone passes it. /A stranded traveler standing on the side of the road is in need of help. /The steeple of a church blocks the road. /A red-faced farmer struggles with a broken wheel on his laden wagon full of carrots. His daughter is quite comely. /A crazy prophet travels this road telling everybody they are just imaginary characters in a game played between gods. /As you negotiate the winding mountain pass you feel a tremor through your feet. Instants later, it becomes a rumble then a roar as rocks begin to fall around you. /What's that? A pale and dead body bobs up and down in the nearby river. Perhaps an aquatic predator killed and stashed it underwater for future meals, and it has floated up. /While you rest alongside the road, a pair of bear cubs wander out playfully towards you, questing for food.

They secure accommodation and food from the friendly locals and fall asleep. In the morning the village is empty and ruined, as if abandoned years ago. /As the road passes through a hilly region, you spy a cave, from which can be heard the voice of a singing female. /As you turn the corner, a dwarf and elf are standing over a stack of goblin corpses. They argue over the kill count. For a twist, change to a hobgoblin and orc, standing over dwarf or elf corpses. /Trudging through a blizzard, you party begin to hear songs in the howling wind - siren songs which are increasingly difficult to ignore. /The path ahead changes from dirt to feathers marched down into the soil then to a thick blanket of feathers. /You come to a large ravine. /A tribe of orcs drives a herd of dire boars to market. /A roc or dragon or flying carpet speeds overhead and drops something glinting into the wilderness near the road. /A gate to another dimension of time or space rips open in front of you. /You awaken from camp surrounded by a parliament of owls.

You have never heard of drop-bears and the traveler seemed to be talking and ranting to himself as he ran off. /A ghost blocks passage. /An approaching funeral procession takes up the whole road, forcing the PCs off the road. /The PCs come to a rough and crumbly road. The ground was disturbed recently by a bulette and the PCs may fall into an empty tunnel, an occupied tunnel (by the bulette or something taking advantage of the tunnel), or just find the road travel difficult. /On the side of the road are dead animals in various stages of decay. You notice a deathly silence around you as your approach the swollen, rotten corpses. /The PCs spot a sword in a stone. /The forest ahead sways as if caught in a violent windstorm, but the party feels no wind. /A woman asks for directions. /A single rowboat floats by on the river beside the road. /The party find a child at the base of a tree trying to rescue a cat caught high in the branches. While the party's attention is diverted upward the little pickpocket goes to work. /A dozen vehicles, each traveling at high-speed, come barreling down the road towards you. /An injured old man lies on the path, but his wounds aren't as bad as they seem. /A sable haired moose prances in the forest clearing. /The gale is of such strength that going against it is difficult, and the flying road dust gets everywhere. Steeds abhor it as it gets in the eyes. Visibility is low and ranged combat upwind near-impossible. /Children sling stones at the party from the fringes of the road. /You are moving along a road through heavy forest. The road ahead is blocked by a mass of trees and debris after a tornado tore through the area. A small village is known to be near. /The smell of bread baking wafts across the road. /Amorous monsters are attracted by one character's smell and begin stalking him. /Someone has scattered caltrops across the road. /Ghouls and zombies emerge from the shadows of the roadside woods. Instead of attacking, the entities wail mysterious warnings to leave the road. /A riderless wild-eyed horse with a saddle slowly stumbles along the road, its flanks heaving from recent exertion. /A lost child sobs beneath an oak tree. /A grass fire burns on the side of the road. /The distant ring of steel disturbs your day's hunt. /As you get the roadside campfire going and put on the pot of beans, the party is surprised by the manifestation of a number of ghostly travellers, silently staring into the fire and attempting to warm their extended, translucent hands. /A tall scarred troll wielding a tree trunk emerges from beneath the bridge you just crossed and demands a toll for crossing "his bridge." /You become very sleepy for no reason. /You pass another group of adventurers resting on the side of the road. The smell of ale and roasting meat fills the air. They smile and wave at you, gesturing to visit. /Many years of spilled blood at a contested crossroads has lent the road itself a dark sentience. Those who camp nearby suffer nightmares and the attacks of evil ghosts. /You encounter a monk, a monkey, a turtle and a pig, all heading west. /A man dressed in black leather darts across the road. He drops a small bag and returns for it as the party examines it. /A weathered sign points off the road, but with no apparent trail to follow. /The end of a rainbow shimmers around an old tree stump. /An old man sits on a tree stump smoking a pipe. /Several signs warn of the contents of a well you can just see atop a hill. /The normally busy road is strangely empty. /The next 100 yards of road are covered with newly grown grass. /A giant waits in ambush behind a recent rockfall, hurling the fallen stones at any who refuse to pay his toll. /A plaintive bleating draws the party's attention to small creatures in their path. The party's wilderness expert declares it to be a host of baby chimeras. /How did these get here? Ladies clothing and under clothing are strewn in the bushes along the road. /A group of pilgrims resting beside the road, all dressed in simple robes. They look exhausted. Many are barefoot and have bloody feet. /A plague of giant blue and yellow locusts starts to cross the road in and around the party. /The Mad Mage, a formerly brilliant wizard, now pesters the party with the incoherent rants of a man driven mad by a botched invisibility spell. /You decide to camp not far from the roadside, but while setting up, a ghost rises up and tries to possess you. (If successful, the PC runs off into the night, leading the party to a cave-in that claimed the ghosts' life, hoping the party will complete his long forgotten quest and allow his spirit to rest. If the possession fails, he beckons the party to follow. If they do not, he flies into a rage and attacks.) /Refugees flee a plague litter coming down the road. /On a desert trail, an oasis appears with several recently-dead animals lying around the water hole. /A peddler wishes to trade with the traveling PCs, most persistently. /All of the food in the area (berries, etc.) has been poisoned or is rotten. /Noble Robin Hood-type outlaws request the party's aid in recovering one of their own captured by an evil overlord. /A small group of men take target practice with crossbows.

A backpack lies nearby. /Overcast day, fog blanketed ground. A moneylender cries in his wagon and the local farmers weep from the famine. This is a bleak and dreary place. /A runaway wagon pulled by a pair of rhinos careens down the road. /A dilapidated vehicle overgrown with edible flora lies near the road. /Ambush: small monstrous humanoids. Hidden threat: soft ground with spikes, tunnels, underbrush. /A group of travellers or pilgrims approach. As they pass, one glances up at a PC and yells "YOU!" /A goblin, on fire, runs shrieking past the party. /So treacherous is the road, one of your mounts has thrown a shoe that cannot be found. There was no smith in the village you left behind. /A goblin warrior proclaims himself the "King of Thieves." He carries a dagger and can hold his own in any battle against the PCs. /The road cuts through a mountainside by means of a tunnel. Partway through, an underground river has broken through to cut across the path, its strong current challenging your progress with roaring rapids in the darkness. /A rock with an odd, glowing rune sits by the road ahead. /Lepers ring their bells and chant. They approach you: "Please milord, spare some coin?" /Swinging from tree to tree, a mischievous band of monkeys besieges the party and try to seize a number of shiny objects. /A noble, disguised as a filthy beggar, tests the party's compassion and generosity. If they pass whatever standard he's set, then he becomes a source of various quests that require personal sacrifice to accomplish. /A dead horse, in full tack, lies dead in a ditch. The saddle bags are full of adventuring equipment, a few gems, a gilded goblet, and a map to what appears to be a treasure trove. Cursory examination shows signs of a struggle and drag marks leading further off the road. /The group sees one group routing another leaving dying and dead behind. /Noxious, bilious green gas covers the road ahead. /An older gentleman hobbles along, apparently injured. If asked, he admits to being caught unawares and attacked by brigands and mumbles he should have known better. He asks the party for an escort until the next crossroads. During the trip (or during the conversation if the party refuse to help) he pick pockets as many of the party as he can for as much as he can. /A young dog or other creature decides to playfully follow the party. /A tree with bark chewed or clawed off at the bottom. /A thin, elderly man hands out copper pieces to every child that walks by. Turns out he is the King. A small gesture to promote his good standing with the people. People who have started to think the old king is growing soft and cold hearted. /A tinker with an over-encumbered mule looks worried the PCs might be evil. The mule stumbles and starts to tip. /A mangy dog eating the carcass of a unrecognizable animal run over by a cart is the center of a swarm of flies and a foul stench. The dog may try to defend its prize, or follow the party, stinking all the while. /A battered chest lies off to the side. /You come across the body of a dead dragon, its' enormous form creates an impassable roadblock. /A stranded traveler standing on the side of the road is a con artist. /A giant skeleton bounds atop a rock cliff. /A loyal mount stands wounded in the road, protecting its unmoving rider who lays supine upon a copious amount of blood.

He then runs into the corn field behind him. /A PCs kicks up a stone that has a strange mark. /The wizard's tower is a stopover for many. A small town has grown around it as a result. /As you trudge forward, a loud cracking sound brings you short. A light flashes brilliantly, then before you appear humanoid figures of no species you've ever encountered. /Walking towards you barefoot is an old monk. He appears to carry only a water skin and staff. He only speaks a regional language. /A circus is set up alongside the road. A barker on the roadside cajoles you to "come inside and see what wonders it holds." /The road crests a hill, and spread out before the group is a stunning, sweeping vista of the land beyond. A painter sits nearby, capturing the scene, and asks the group to pose for his foreground. /A large chunk of ornate (and possibly foreign) masonry blocks the road, with signs it recently fell out of the sky. /The sign next to the road has an illustration of a monster and reads "Violent Wild Beast Crossing." /A dirt dwarf crawls out from the local dump sprawling across the road. The smell is putrid. /The party finds a grouping of shallow caves laid out in a precise geometric pattern. /The road is rigged with an obvious and clumsily or hastily made trap. The PCs can hear drunken giggling from the undergrowth. /A woman on the road yells for help, saying bandits robbed her and her husband and left her husband for dead. She leads the PCs to her husband who is close to death and needs immediate medical attention. If he dies then the party has gained a hanger-on they have to take to at least the next town, if not all the way home. If he doesn't die they have to find a way to travel to the next town with a dying man. /Near the road is a mound the size of a grave, obviously of recent excavation, marked at its head by an upright stake. /The air suddenly becomes cold or hot. /A rowboat sits on the side of the road. There is no river or stream nearby. /After a recent storm, a small rivulet crosses the road. All around it lay the bodies of dead birds and small rodents. /A travelling peddler sells curses. /A path from the road leads to a collapsed house overgrown with foliage. /A collie stands in the middle of the road, it awaits the PCs and then tries to lead them somewhere. The dog leads them to an abandoned well in the woods. Ideas for the well: It leads to a dungeon with the collie's lost master trapped inside. Or "Timmy" is a troll using the dog to lead prey to his well. /It is dark and a commoner stands next to a wagon with a torch, yelling a woman's name and begging her to come back. After a fight over something stupid, like when to camp for the night, she stomped off into the dark woods. The twist: his wife is a visibly obvious monster (like a giantess or centaur). /As you turn the corner, a dwarf and elf are standing over a stack of goblin corpses. They argue over the kill count. For a twist, change to a hobgoblin and orc, standing over dwarf or elf corpses. /On the side of the road an old man and woman yell at each other about who forgot to pack lunch. /A knight of a holy church and his retinue have ridden out on a holy crusade against evil and demand others who serve the cause of good to join their cause on the spot. /Many years of spilled blood at a contested crossroads has lent the road itself a dark sentience. Those who camp nearby suffer nightmares and the attacks of evil ghosts. /You pass an inn at a crossroads when a sudden blast tears away the wall. /Kobolds attack a merchant's wagon. Two kobolds attack the door with hatchets. The door blows open and a kobold is thrown out of the wagon. A dwarf appears in the doorway, brandishing a hammer. The dwarven merchant has purchased some of the kobold tribes' eggs, which were stolen from their lair yesterday by an opportunistic rogue. The kobolds have tracked the eggs to the wagon, killing the rogue en route a few miles away. /Ahead, on the side of the road, sits a man, apparently a farmer. In his hands is a shredded blue dress, the size of a child and he clutches it to his chest, sobbing. Behind him is the smoldering ruins of a farmhouse. /A dead horse, in full tack, lies dead in a ditch. The saddle bags are full of adventuring equipment, a few gems, a gilded goblet, and a map to what appears to be a treasure trove. Cursory examination shows signs of a struggle and drag marks leading further off the road. /A wagon ahead has overturned. It appears to have been carrying four large metal containers that are now scattered about. The driver lies dead, some wicked pustules marking his exposed skin. One of the containers looks like it might be leaking some sort of liquid. /A wizard lies slain in the road, his insane Homunculus protects his body and belongings, swearing vengeance on all who disturb the corpse. /In need of food and shelter from the elements (or from enemies), the characters come to a ruined tower full of reveling adventurers.

Which is safer or faster? And which is more comfortable and easier to travel? What's the cost for either route? How do the PCs get this information? Can they trust the source? /An empty noose hangs from a thick branch overhead. /Flies are buzzing around a shoe containing a foot in front of you. /A wandering cleric begs the heroes to recover a relic for them. /A nobleman's retinue is travelling up behind the PCs. Expect the guards to be rash and impolite. /A pair of rangers fine-tunes their skills piercing a melon 600 paces away. Half a dozen arrows already riddle the fruit. /A potion lies on the road.

One face looks familiar to a PC. /From an old roadside shrine to an unknown god the group hears crying. A naked newborn baby lies upon the altar in a beam of sunlight, with no sign of anyone else about. /The road ahead forks in six directions. /A huge nest has fallen from a tree on the side of the road, and the strange-looking eggs within seem on the verge of hatching. /Gravity seems to have been defied when you come across an upside down bridge. Is it just an optical illusion, did the builders read the plan upside down or is there more to this than first appears? /The PCs spot a small cave up a nearby hill. Is it a shelter or a lair? /The King's messenger needs a fresh horse. /A rift to another dimension appears in the middle of the road. It might take the form of a rainbow end, a dark and crackling portal or a simple hole in the ground. /A dwarf falls from the sky. /A wind elemental likes to cause havoc along this road.

Dealer's choice, on this one./A rusty animated sword speaks up, attempting to get the party to take him with them. He looks very shitty, but gets a nice bonus to hit and is knowledgeable about something relevant to the party. If the party needs information the sword has, he will be very long winded and roundabout in his answer, happy to finally just have attention./A sketchy looking man attempts to sell the party a Basilisk egg for 1200gp./The party's path leads them through an arboretum of sentient trees, enchanted by a lonely old female wizard who sees the trees as a sort-of-progeny. If the party takes the bait and chats with her, have her mention that she would love if they could bring her any other sort of magical artifacts, and that she'd reward them for it :) Also, potential here for a love twist to be brought in. Have the party search for a sexy old wizard?
