# Nicole Walter's Dungeons and Dragons Utility Tool

## Description
This is a utility tool for Dungeon Masters, built on D&D Next. It is meant to help inspire creativity in DMs who might not be as good as they'd like at crafting interesting NPCs and fun encounters on the fly!

On the site, you'll find the following sections:

### Non-Player Characters
This section allows you to create NPCs for your campaign! Each NPC has one of many races from all given source material, including Unearthed Arcana! A new name will be randomly generated, as well as a brief description of the NPC.

Sometimes you may find the description of an NPC to contradict itself, and this is fine! Its meant to serve as creative inspiration, so modify it to your hearts content!

### Creatures and Encounters
This section allows you to not only search for specific creatures by Name/XP/Environment/Type/Book/Alignment/Size, but also to create encounters for the creatures you've searched!

For example, I might want to create a zoo of massive creatures in my world, so I could search for all creatures of type "Beast" and sizes "Huge" & "Gargantuan"!

I might then want to build an encounter on an XP budget of, say, 5000XP. I enter that value here and click Create Encounter and off we go!

Note: If you add up the XP of the creatures in the encounter and find that it differs from the Total Encounter XP, it may be because D&D has a rule (DMG pg.82) that for X number of creatures in an encounter, the xp budget is multiplied Y times.

### Calculate XP Budget

But if I'm not certain what my XP budget is for a hard encounter with a party of 5 adventurers with an average level of 6, then I can calculate it in this section!

Here you can specify the number of characters, their average level, and the difficulty of the encounter.

### Treasure Hoard

If you've already generated an encounter, you may have noticed that this section filled in automatically. Everytime an encounter is generated the XP total fills into this section and generates a treasure hoard based on rules in DMG!

Most items here are straight out of the DMG, but I've also added some new valuables as well as procedurally generated magic items. You are encouraged to get creative with these!

### Generate Words

This is my favorite part of the site! Here you can generate random words (or a sentence) for a given language! Each language is built on a custom set of english words that all sound similar. This means that when you generate words in a given language, the new words will have a distinct sound! This is very useful for being able to speak to your players in a language none of their PCs will understand.

So, select your number of words, their min/max length, and the language!

Dwarvish, for example, was built on all words that have a SH/CH/TH/J sound, and thus, when I generate random Dwarvish words I get:

`shed guri shonkse shejooif pes`

Here I can also generate a sentence! Yuan Ti was built on all words that have W/V/Z/X/S sounds, so lets see what that looks like!

`Das smps sks wans Yowags vudsda vorose - davesy ano?`

You'll notice that the Generate Sentence button doesn't allow you to set a number words/min/max length. It simply generates a random sentence of varying words of varying length, with random punctuation! Perfect for creating idle chatter in another language to hlep immerse your players!

### Summary

You can do a lot of fun things on this site, and I hope it helps you grow your campaign! You can use the links above or below to access the site at your whimsy. The actual URL is pasted below as well.
